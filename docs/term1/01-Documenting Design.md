The seminar of Documenting Design explain us the importance of *DOCUMENTATION* (=PROCESS OF *RECORDING, CAPTURING, AND PRESERVING INFORMATION, DETAILS, AND EVENTS IN A STRUCTURED MANNER*).

The act of documenting- so writing down our ideas, reflection or show images or video- is useful to spread our thoughts to other people and to preserve the mental processes that we do for an activity.

Itâ€™s also a way to organize all the chaos that i have in my  mind and let it be understandable to myself

In addiction, itâ€™s important to add a proper **narrative** to the elements of documentation,

> NARRATIVE
> 
> - Characters
> - Context
> - Plot
> - Conflict
> - Resolution
> - Emotion
> - Visuals
> - Reflection
> - Narrative Flow

 for this reason each of us in the class have to create and update a personal website with all the contents and reflections about the journey here at IAAC.

So, two things that Iâ€™ve never use so to do will be part of my everyday life: coding and documenting. If i have to be honest, iâ€™m not so good on keep things updated in one singular space, because i tend to create or use many spaces to annotate things, but i have to admit that this way is not really useful and it doesnâ€™t help my mind to remember all the concepts; in addiction i always change my mind about the structure on how i want to keep my notes, mostly because I let myself be influenced by otherâ€™s ideas, which in part is helpful, but on the other hand makes me lose my own creativity;this is the reason why i want to keep my template similar to the default one, in order to costumize it only with my small editigs, and when iâ€™ll be ready, iâ€™ll chose my own structure and interface.

At present, I'm giving my best effort to both documenting and coding. ðŸ˜Š
