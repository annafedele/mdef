# Design With Others

**WHAT’S A COMMUNITY? COLLECTIVE OF THINGS/BEINGS, complex formation of elements** 

Paradoxes of SOIL AND LAND (FOOD AND HOUSING)
SOIL as nature cultural system, more than human community, sub-human
LAND as sociotechnical system, micro and macro natural system, creative arena
FROM MICRO TO MACRO (perpetual shifting)
LOCAL SYMPTOMS, COMMUNITIES AND SITUATED RESEARCH 
→ SYSTEMIC, MACRO-long TERM INTERVENING 
**UNDERSTANDING, CONNECTING, INTERVENE** 



##  DAY 1, SOIL


*ASSAMBLAGES→ Assemblages are composed of heterogeneous elements or objects that enter into relations with one another. These objects are not all of the same type. Thus you have physical objects, happenings, events, and so on, but you also have signs, utterances, and so on. While there are assemblages that are composed entirely of bodies, there are no assemblages composed entirely of signs and utterances.* 

ASSEMBLAGES OF SOIL-> Mix of microorganisms (or issues of waste) connecting elements issues ,logistics, infrastructures , 

As a first activity, they ask us to go around and take picture on what for us could be a *friction,conflict or tension* in soil.
During my research hour i've noticed that in that specif area, (close to a playground) that there were a lot of toys leave by the children. 
i've reflected on the fact that children, unlike the others, don't "*trought*" away something on the ground and leave it on purpose: their intentions are pure (as a angel generation)  and they also use the soil as their fantasy playgrond.

Back from the activity, i found my affinity group sharing the concept of **AGEISM**


## AFTERNOON ACTIVITY

**Build a systemic view of your territory**

- Stakeholder mapping and analyze the context through an holistic diagnosis
- Ensure the alignment of your internal team vision for circular transitions and be aware of constraints and differences

**Assess your community**

- Engage the community through canvassing, door knocking, and participating in community events.
- Understand the barriers of sharing power and/or access that prevents diverse co-creators from coming and working together
- Address those barriers and include their voices. It takes work and it is hard, but the output will be stronger.

DISTRIBUTED DESIGN→ approach to design that goes from product in trash out to product in and out 

Spread, thought data KNOWLEDGE (A COMMUNITY) 

MAKER MOVEMENT→ working with design sensitivity

## DAY 2, LAND

LA BORDA→ social housing, sharing spaces collaborative space (they collaborate to build the space and the utilities)

Freedom as exercising reciprocity (way of relating)

## DAY 3 SOIL AND LAND (CONFLICT SPACE)

CONFLICT: How can we foster connectivity and inclusivity between communities that practice hands on techniques to create art and those who rely entirely on technology to do the same.

    ## Reflection
    The design with others seminar was a very interactive and a seminar that was very eyeopening.
    The first day of this module began with an informative session about soil and the interesting concepts that revolve around the community. Seeing communities through a different lens was taught me the importance of the needs and desires of communities in the rural parts of Barcelona.

    Discovering the community in the second half of first day allowed me to find out the artists community and the toy makers in the area. We (Me, Ana, Qian Yin and Manuja) had the opportunity to speak to an old artist and a toy maker called Juan. He shared with us his experience about being an old artist in the community that is slowly all becoming digital. We had the privilege to see his entire workspace and the tools he uses to create his masterpieces. 
    This small interaction gave me the idea to work more in this field for the intervention through a creative way to depict art forms. 

    The second day of the seminar was more about walking around the community and we had the opportunity to go see the Holon housing and see their sustainable way of living. I personally believe that was very important to see first hand and get a first person perspective on living so sustainably. Upon having the seminar on hollow housing, we divided ourselves into groups and worked on our intervention. 
    
    Filling the different miro boards and going into the depth with the research of the community, was super helpful to narrow down the community area that we wanted to work within. As a group after having discussed the area that we wanted to focus on, we tried to come up with ideas to solve the issue. As a group we created a card game to bridge the gap between intergenerational artists and the different art forms and mediums. 
    
    Creating this game was not only a fun activity but it also allowed me to learn a lot about how I can creatively solve a deep issue so lightly. Overall, the design with others seminar taught me tremendously in depth of the importance of keeping in mind of communities while designing.
