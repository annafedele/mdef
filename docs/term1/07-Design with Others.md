# Design With Others

WHAT’S A COMMUNITY? COLLECTIVE OF THINGS/BEINGS, complex formation of elements 

Paradoxes of SOIL AND LAND (FOOD AND HOUSING)
SOIL as nature cultural system, more than human community, sub-human
LAND as sociotechnical system, micro and macro natural system, creative arena
FROM MICRO TO MACRO (perpetual shifting)
LOCAL SYMPTOMS, COMMUNITIES AND SITUATED RESEARCH 
→ SYSTEMIC, MACRO-long TERM INTERVENING 
**UNDERSTANDING, CONNECTING, INTERVENE**

## 

*ASSAMBLAGES→ Assemblages are composed of heterogeneous elements or objects that enter into relations with one another. These objects are not all of the same type. Thus you have physical objects, happenings, events, and so on, but you also have signs, utterances, and so on. While there are assemblages that are composed entirely of bodies, there are no assemblages composed entirely of signs and utterances.* 

ASSEMBLAGES OF SOIL

Mix of microorganisms (or issues of waste) connecting elements issues ,logistics, infrastructures , 

FOOD SYSTEM 

**FRICTION, CONFLICT, TENSION IN SOIL**

AGEISM

## AFTERNOON ACTIVITY

**Build a systemic view of your territory**

- Stakeholder mapping and analyze the context through an holistic diagnosis
- Ensure the alignment of your internal team vision for circular transitions and be aware of constraints and differences

**Assess your community**

- Engage the community through canvassing, door knocking, and participating in community events.
- Understand the barriers of sharing power and/or access that prevents diverse co-creators from coming and working together
- Address those barriers and include their voices. It takes work and it is hard, but the output will be stronger.

DISTRIBUTED DESIGN→ approach to design that goes from product in trash out to product in and out 

Spread, thought data KNOWLEDGE (A COMMUNITY) 

MAKER MOVEMENT→ working with design sensitivity

# DAY 2, LAND

LA BORDA→ social housing, sharing spaces collaborative space (they collaborate to build the space and the utilities)

Freedom as exercising reciprocity (way of relating)

# SOIL AND LAND (CONFLICT SPACE)

CONFLICT: people getting outdated 

productivity, doing more in less time

who already working on reinsert people in society in cataloya
