## Design Studio 01
*03.10*

During my past experience as a product designer I’ve learnt that the action of prototyping an idea is the best way to spread it and make it one step closer to become real. Prototype makes you realize things that in your mind have a theoretically a direction and a sense, but sometimes they take another way when you try to basically make them; and i’m not talking only about the physical part of a product like dimensions and materials, but also concepts and ideas: i think that prototyping can let you understand even how your idea is communicated, or which status is it. 

In my  opinion, it’s really interesting how prototyping could involve people, binding them to each other ideas in order to participate to an effective **design intervention:** prototyping is the medium of an intervention, a tangible way of sharing ideas.

During the lecture, we spoke about 4 types of prototyping: 

**Roles of Prototyping**

- *PP as experimental component*, (most common) testing specifing hyopthesis
- *PP as a meas of inquiry*, that gives you something back (collect, record and measure)
- *PP as a research archetype*, physical embodiments of concepts (exeplary and illustrative)
- *PP as a vehicle of inquiry*, focus on process of making (answer qestion by making)

Reflecting on these four types of prototyping related to design interventions, i think that I’ve use many times the first type, in an academic way, but it’s the third type that interested me the most: I’ve had the chance to see and learn about many “research archetype prototypes”, as I’ve work in a contemporary art gallery. There, we host not only artworks, but entire e complete projects with an specific aim, so i had experienced the design intervention in both ways: as a spectator, but also as a part of the making process because i was the medium inside the gallery to comunicate people the projects.



## GROUP EXERCISE

We also did an activity related into changing roles of PP of our classmates old projects. I choose Jorge’s project that was about designing a lint roller. We collocated his project in the PP’s role 1, as the prototype was made to experiment a specific idea.
I thought that it could be interesting move the emphasis of the project not on the object itself, but on the materials and the process what this object could be make. So I’ve designed a toolkit where the part of the lint roller are modular and in different materials, focusing on the PP’s role 4.
