> *At its most basic, machine learning means automating tasks by providing examples (training data) instead of writing instructions (code). Fueled by the rise of new algorithms, new hardware, new toolkits for efficiently solvin*g complex problems, and huge datasets compiled from everything from sensor networks and surveillance cameras to social media, machine learning has come of age.”*

## Visiting the exhbition "AI: Artificial Intelligence" at CCCB

We had the chance to visit the AI exhibition here in Barcelona, that, i've personally really enjoyed because it displays the relationship with AI in many different fields, traslated into projects that explore the capabilities of this new frontier.
In the entire exhibition i've found some projects that really interest me:


## Latent spaces

*Formally, a latent space is defined as an abstract multidimensional space that encodes a meaningful internal representation of externally observed events.*

I find this concept really load of meanings, but also, the way as this is dispayed in a digital way even if it's something really teoretical is really fascinating.
