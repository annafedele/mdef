The first week was pretty intense but also amazing because they trying to let immerge us in the district of Poblenou and in the IAAC approach, and both of them are really different from the reality that i was used to see: in Bologna, and in particular in my university all the things and courses were more theoretical and you need to discover new communities by yourself, but sometimes they’re very hidden or exclusive.

Here in Barcelona the feeling that i had was that the spaces, even IAAC, are so open to share their knowledge and i can also see the bound between each other.

Another thing that I’ve really enjoyed this week was that we did an activity together to my our class more “our space”, so we went to the laboratories and we immediatly start to build tables, useful during the labs seminars. I really love the approach of doing and making because i was used to think a lot before starting doing something and most of times it stayed theoretical. We had also a great teamwork!

Finally on friday we visited the ELISAVA school where some experts explain us about the lab that they have, (btw they’re a lot). ELISAVA is also another reality different from IAAC maybe with an a scholastic approch, but the labs are really amazing, letting us the possibility to develop project in many different ways and with many different medium.
