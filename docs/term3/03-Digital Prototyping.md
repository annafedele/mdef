## Task 4, Prototyping for interaction design

*Prototype and train a model that has three different OSC messages with Carmen*

Both Carmen and I are working on our projects in the more social sphere.
The reference was to create a kind of online phone call where, based on the emotions and movements detected, the camera feed would change colour and sound depending on how the person on the other end interacts with you. 
The inputs should be: Soft sensor, phone and face.

### Soft sensor
we started by developing these first sensors created with fabrics and the velostat, i.e. this marial that allows the resistance between two charges to vary and thus be able to measure the pressure applied at a given point. We first created a single sensor and then a matrix that, connected to processing, could map the area of the sensor and detect the position of where the change in pressure is applied to the touch
