# Where we were left off?
## Design Dialogues I

The second intervention makes me realize how much the topics that we explore for the project interest me and gives me some suggestions on how to go on with them and exploring other points of view about the relationship with the body: for example, the usage of sensors and biomaterials, making digital seem like human skin, recreate properties.
So I've tried to take the speculative part of this intervention and reflect on what it means to violate the body.

*Healing*
The body, and more specifically the skin,has the incredible property of healing wounds and preserving itself from external agents that can injure it. I therefore began an experimental phase that put me to the test with the use of biomaterials and sensors to simulate wound healing and thus form another layer of skin, a human-derived one, that protects the body.

*Pain=Prompt*
I wondered how artificial intelligence could see terrible concepts such as violence and abuse, being based on datasets created in turn by human beings. I found it interesting to relate stories of fear and abuse to the generation of images and find, surprisingly, an extreme gap between what I imagined and what the AI generated.

# Feedback
Summarily my research brought to the design dialogues brought positive feedback and stimulated interesting dialogues both with my colleagues and as outsiders; solprendently the focus was more on the design part of the images realised in AI, also because I had arranged the images interactively so that everyone could 'unveil' them by pretending a dark room with black ink. On the exhibition level, I realised that I want to stay with this type of arrangement.
Moreover, the most relevant comments were on the one hand to investigate and research how to make a biomaterial, (or a tissue) as responsive as if it were a human tissue, also to introduce a still very controversial reflection: when two bodies interact, touch each other, where is the line that defines the behaviour as innocent to the point of violence? it is so thin... 
In addition, thoughts have arisen on the filters contained in AI from an ethical point of view, whether we need them, they protect us or are an obstacle that will increasingly limit us.
