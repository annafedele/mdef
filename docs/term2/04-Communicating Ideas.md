*storytelling*, 

comunicate design projects

life document as a project

storytelling as an evolving process, part of our nature

communication model

encoder and decoder giving **messages and feedbacks** between each other

explaining things in different ways starting from a diff point of view or a different background

**context-characters-point of view-argument**

narrative structures:

mountain→ drama goes in a crescendo and goes in a solution

nested loops→ starts from  the centre and start getting more info in a concentric way

spark-lines→ plot between hope and reality

in media res→ the timeline in not linear (going back for going foward)

covering ideas→ converging ideas

monomyth→ like “the hero journey”

1. a captivating start

## Defining my project

### The Golden Circle

![Alt text](<../images/Risorsa 1GDLCIRC.png>){: .image-40-size-left}
**WHAT?**
I try to create both a tangible and conceptual bridge between transhumanist applications, biohacking, use of new materials and new ways of seeing things, with the current issue of gender violence, what it means when there is contact between two bodies and how to define it.

**HOW?**
The method is defined by experimenting with new techniques and materials in both scientific and creative ways, ranging from sample tests to wearable applications. In addition, it is essential for me to refer to communities or experts who deal with or use the same means as me on a practical level, but it is important for me to interface with the people directly concerned (women victims of violence, ...) from a more empathetic and emotional point of view.

**WHY?**
What I would like to dedicate myself to are topics that are very close to my heart and where I feel very empathetic about them, it is a goal that stems from external stimuli that I have reworked within myself, but at the same time I want to present them externally, for others, in a new light and possibly also do something about it, changing things is definitely my goal, even if at the moment it seems very far away and ambitious


## Tandem project, *with annna*

I start my tandem project with Annna, starting researching about her project on the exagerating of ugliness exaltation and exaggeration of ugliness (relating to human and non-human beings) through the use of technology.

We recorded this video together to explain some points that I thought were interesting about his project starting with the topics of inspiration, influences from his background and future involvement of communities or institutions.
