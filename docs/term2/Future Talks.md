## #1 Design with values

#### Intrduction to distributed design
we start the talk introducing the Distributed Design Platform as a way to develop and promote the connection between designers, makers and emerging digital and local markets. 

#### Reflection Tree
I based the Reflection Tree self-assessment on my three-year thesis project: i.e. the conception of a production method involving the reuse of fabric leftovers and generative design methodology in order to create a design product

It was an interesting activity because it made me break down my project and self-evaluate it according to the parameters of open source, collaboration, social, environmental and value regeneration, and inclusiveness. The evaluation revealed the strengths and weaknesses of the project, and the activity made me reflect on how I could improve and implement my project in the future.

- **key takeaways**
The section where I gained the most points is the Environmentally regenerative section precisely because the project I selected was based on this type of values and pushes to increasingly use the available technological knowledge to increase the life cycle of a material and thus the circular economy. so I am happy that my project reflects the environmental and design innovation values mentioned in the reflection tree.
Secondly, the area most lacking is that of inclusivity: although the project could be attentive to the material cycle and the use of innovative techniques for non-industrial but customised production, it is a little far from expanding the target audience, which at the moment is still niche despite the fact that the project communication is available to all. In addition, the technology assumed for production is high-end, so that also restricts the accessibility for users.
I would therefore also like to take these aspects into consideration in the future

- **Reflection**
I think that the Reflection Tree is a really good to to use in order to understande how a project is accessible or environmentally generative or inclusive. It  helped me to understand what were pros and cons of my project but especially, made me reflect on what i could improve.
