Prototype makes you realize things that in your mind have a theoretically a direction and a sense, but sometimes they take another way when you try to basically make them; and i\u2019m not talking only about the physical part of a product like dimensions and materials, but also concepts and ideas: i think that prototyping can let you understand even how your idea is communicated, or which status is it. In my opinion, it\u2019s really interesting how prototyping could involve people, binding them to each other ideas in order to participate to an effective design intervention: prototyping is the medium of an intervention, a tangible way of sharing ideas. During the lecture, we spoke about 4 types of prototyping: Roles of Prototyping PP as experimental component , (most common) testing specifing hyopthesis PP as a meas of inquiry , that gives you something back (collect, record and measure) PP as a research archetype , physical embodiments of concepts (exeplary and illustrative) PP as a vehicle of inquiry , focus on process of making (answer qestion by making) Reflecting on these four types of prototyping related to design interventions, i think that I\u2019ve use many times the first type, in an academic way, but it\u2019s the third type that interested me the most: I\u2019ve had the chance to see and learn about many \u201cresearch archetype prototypes\u201d, as I\u2019ve work in a contemporary art gallery. There, we host not only artworks, but entire e complete projects with an specific aim, so i had experienced the design intervention in both ways: as a spectator, but also as a part of the making process because i was the medium inside the gallery to comunicate people the projects. GROUP EXERCISE \u00b6 We also did an activity related into changing roles of PP of our classmates old projects. I choose Jorge\u2019s project that was about designing a lint roller. We collocated his project in the PP\u2019s role 1, as the prototype was made to experiment a specific idea. I thought that it could be interesting move the emphasis of the project not on the object itself, but on the materials and the process what this object could be make.

Using a computer-aided design (CAD) model as a blueprint, the printer adds material layer by layer, whether it\u2019s thermoplastic, resin, or metal, to form a solid object. Different printing technologies, such as Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Stereolithography (SLA), or Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), dictate the type of material and the layering process, resulting in a tangible product that mirrors the digital design. \u200d How does it work? The 3D printer works by interpreting a digital 3D model, slicing it into thin horizontal layers using specialized software, and then building the object layer by layer through additive manufacturing. Depending on the technology used, the printer deposits material, such as thermoplastic filament, liquid resin, or metal powder, layer by layer, with each layer fusing to the one below. The material is solidified using various methods like heating, UV curing, or laser sintering, resulting in a three-dimensional object that matches the digital design. \u200d How is it built? The 3D printer is constructed using a combination of mechanical, electronic, and software components. Mechanically, it features a frame that houses the moving parts, including the print head or extruder, and a build platform. These components are driven by motors, guided by linear rails or rods, ensuring precise movements on the X, Y, and Z axes. Electronically, a main control board processes digital instructions from the slicing software, directing the motors and regulating the temperature of the print head or curing source. Additionally, various sensors monitor conditions like temperature and filament presence, while the software interface allows users to configure settings, load models, and initiate the printing process. \u200d Why it failed, or it wasn\u2019t used anymore? The 3D printer still functions, but it\u2019s an older, unstable model with low accuracy and print quality. Powering things up \u00b6 \u200d After the disassembly process, we meticulously examined each individual component. Utilizing a precision lab power supply and a high-resolution multimeter, we conducted comprehensive tests to determine the optimal voltage required for each component\u2019s functionality. \u200d WHAT WE POWER UP DC Lab Power Supply - How we brought individual 3D Printer components back to life We monitored the temperature of the hot plate while gradually increasing the voltage We check the temperature sensor looking at the values We dissasemble the part of the extruder Results \u00b6 How many motors did we find inside? Five motors - they are used to move the extruder in the three axis to permit drawing in 3D space. \u200d Does it contain a computer or microcontroller? Yes, an Arduino board and a RAMPS. Did you found any sensors? Yes, temperature sensors. Conclusions \u00b6 What did you learn? How a 3D printer is assembled How a 3D printer works How to power up each component individually Fundamental electronics How a step motor works \u200d What surprised you? The number of components, screws and pieces the printer had The fact that we can make the extruder work with just 3 components How easy and repareable it is How much the 3D technology has improved since 2015 (Almost Useful) Machines - LifeX \u00b6 In Week 2 of the \u2018Machine Paradox\u2019 phase, we took our achievements from Week 1 to the next level. While the initial week was dedicated to disassembling and testing individual components, this week presented us with a unique challenge: to innovate and craft a new product using parts extracted from the printer. An intriguing twist to this assignment was the directive to design the machine to be as whimsical and non-functional as possible. This encouraged us to let our creativity run wild and embrace a playful approach. Even with a treasure trove of components at our disposal from the 3D printer\u2014including two motors, an extruder, and more\u2014we embraced an audacious and captivating concept: the LifeX, a so-called \u2018life expectancy predictor\u2019. \u200d At its core, LifeX uses the X-axis motor and belt system. With a simple push of a button, a pen draws a line on a paper below, supposedly predicting the age at which the user will pass away. It\u2019s a tongue-in-cheek nod to the dubious claims of some fortune tellers. In truth, an Arduino board is programmed to halt at a random number, influenced by the moment the user activates it. The motor maneuvers the pen across what we playfully dub your \u2018life bookmark\u2019, a creation thoughtfully crafted by one of our talented team members. This ticket, more than just a whimsical prediction, serves as a keepsake from this pseudo-paranormal encounter. Hold onto it and cherish the memory of this unique experience! We were privileged to be part of a diverse team, boasting a rich tapestry of skills from varied backgrounds. This multidisciplinary blend, from engineering acumen to artistic flair, was instrumental in propelling our project to completion. It was this collective genius that birthed such a unique and delightful machine. One of the most captivating stages of our journey was the decision-making process regarding which parts to repurpose from the printer and what additional elements we would introduce. We strategically utilized only essential components, complementing them with bespoke pieces crafted through 3D printing, CNC, and laser techniques\u2014thanks to the advanced digital fabrication facilities available at our school. video here!","title":"The Machine Paradox"},{"location":"term1/04-The%20Machine%20Paradox/#the-machine-paradox","text":"17.10-27.10 3D MODEL","title":"THE MACHINE PARADOX"},{"location":"term1/04-The%20Machine%20Paradox/#forensic-report-fundaciocim-3d-printer","text":"Serial number: 01 150929 1189 Brand: FUNDACIOCIM Year: 2015 Model: BCN3D+ Weight: 11,6 kg Colour: BLACK/BLUE Made in: SPAIN","title":"Forensic Report: FundacioCIM 3D Printer"},{"location":"term1/04-The%20Machine%20Paradox/#forensic-questions","text":"What does it do? \u200d A 3D printer is a device that creates three-dimensional objects by layering material based on a digital design.
