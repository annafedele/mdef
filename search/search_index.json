The act of documenting- so writing down our ideas, reflection or show images or video- is useful to spread our thoughts to other people and to preserve the mental processes that we do for an activity. It\u2019s also a way to organize all the chaos that i have in my mind and let it be understandable to myself In addiction, it\u2019s important to add a proper narrative to the elements of documentation, NARRATIVE Characters Context Plot Conflict Resolution Emotion Visuals Reflection Narrative Flow for this reason each of us in the class have to create and update a personal website with all the contents and reflections about the journey here at IAAC. So, two things that I\u2019ve never use so to do will be part of my everyday life: coding and documenting. If i have to be honest, i\u2019m not so good on keep things updated in one singular space, because i tend to create or use many spaces to annotate things, but i have to admit that this way is not really useful and it doesn\u2019t help my mind to remember all the concepts; in addiction i always change my mind about the structure on how i want to keep my notes, mostly because I let myself be influenced by other\u2019s ideas, which in part is helpful, but on the other hand makes me lose my own creativity;this is the reason why i want to keep my template similar to the default one, in order to costumize it only with my small editigs, and when i\u2019ll be ready, i\u2019ll chose my own structure and interface. At present, I\u2019m giving my best effort to both documenting and coding. \ud83d\ude0a","title":"Documenting Design"},{"location":"term1/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/","text":"Atlas of Weak Signals \u00b6 In the seminar \u201cAtlas of weak signals\u201d, they explained us how to build our Design Space, as a space of interests we\u2019d like to investigate in many field related to an emergent future situation.

Prototype makes you realize things that in your mind have a theoretically a direction and a sense, but sometimes they take another way when you try to basically make them; and i\u2019m not talking only about the physical part of a product like dimensions and materials, but also concepts and ideas: i think that prototyping can let you understand even how your idea is communicated, or which status is it. In my opinion, it\u2019s really interesting how prototyping could involve people, binding them to each other ideas in order to participate to an effective design intervention: prototyping is the medium of an intervention, a tangible way of sharing ideas. During the lecture, we spoke about 4 types of prototyping: Roles of Prototyping PP as experimental component , (most common) testing specifing hyopthesis PP as a meas of inquiry , that gives you something back (collect, record and measure) PP as a research archetype , physical embodiments of concepts (exeplary and illustrative) PP as a vehicle of inquiry , focus on process of making (answer qestion by making) Reflecting on these four types of prototyping related to design interventions, i think that I\u2019ve use many times the first type, in an academic way, but it\u2019s the third type that interested me the most: I\u2019ve had the chance to see and learn about many \u201cresearch archetype prototypes\u201d, as I\u2019ve work in a contemporary art gallery. There, we host not only artworks, but entire e complete projects with an specific aim, so i had experienced the design intervention in both ways: as a spectator, but also as a part of the making process because i was the medium inside the gallery to comunicate people the projects. Group exercise \u00b6 We also did an activity related into changing roles of PP of our classmates old projects. I choose Jorge\u2019s project that was about designing a lint roller. We collocated his project in the PP\u2019s role 1, as the prototype was made to experiment a specific idea. I thought that it could be interesting move the emphasis of the project not on the object itself, but on the materials and the process what this object could be make. So I\u2019ve designed a toolkit where the part of the lint roller are modular and in different materials, focusing on the PP\u2019s role 4. DESIGN INTERVENTION \u00b6 31.01-5.11 Unfourtunatly i wasn\u2019t able to participate to the exercise about the collective design workspace with the whole class, but i found out that there were other people that were missing on monday, so we created a group composed by Nicol\u00f2, Anthuanet, Sophie, Marius and I We initiated our journey during this initial Design Intervention by exchanging our personal Design Spaces. Despite our diverse backgrounds and varying aspirations, we unearthed a shared set of common values. 1.1 Process \u00b6 So, we collocated the place of our intrvention in metro stations: People from diverse backgrounds utilize public transportation, placing them in direct contact with the myriad conditions and experiences it entails. The underground environment is intriguing not only in terms of shared space among individuals but also in its interaction with bacteria, noise, stress, recreation, education, and more. Our goal is to raise awareness about the air quality conditions in public transportation, with a specific emphasis on Barcelona\u2019s Metro System. As governments and citizens increasingly call for expanded public transit networks, it becomes essential to assess and unveil the environmental consequences of these systems 1.2 Ideation and prototyping \u00b6 To address this challenge, we\u2019ve armed ourselves with a PM2.5 sensor. Evaluating PM2.5 levels is critical for assessing air quality because these particles serve as vital indicators of health risks stemming from air pollution. PM2.5 refers to particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller. These minuscule particles are capable of penetrating deep into the lungs and can even enter the bloodstream, leading to significant health issues. We\u2019ve connected this sensor to a speaker that provides real-time feedback on air quality at various stations within Barcelona\u2019s Metro. During a typical commute from La Pau Station to Bogatell on the L4 Metro, (that\u2019s my journey to reach IAAC) we used the sensor\u2019s readings to audibly illustrate the invisible airborne threats we unknowingly inhale. After the intervention we discovered that, in average the values of PM2.5 were lower in 6 stations, but raise in Besos and Bogatell, due to the scarse air ventilation in the metro station or the affluence of people According to me, the most interesting thing about this intervention ,a part from the enviromental sensing, was the fact that we were able to create a little project with a specific purpose, related also to sensors, in a few time. it will be interesting to develop the intervention adding some other values to evaluate or to costumize the box that we use for the sensing: changing the materials, the shape and the composition of the electronic parts inside. 1.3 Video \u00b6 Narrative and story-telling \u00b6 6.11 Here some notes and definitions of the topics that we explored with Laura POWER RELATIONS\u2192 (Espinoza) negative/oppressive\u2192 potestas (surveillance) positive/empowering\u2192 potentia Both happened at the same time (we\u2019re exercizing in power) WHAT THE BODY CAN DO (corresponds to the nature and its capacity to be affected ) affected (and being affected) as relations, networks Wor(l)ding (wording and worlding)\u2192 focus on human/ non-human agencies (entaglement), turning attetionas to certian experience, our active engagment (commitment) 1PP+SE= a particular world emerges from the individual related with a number oh phenomena embodied process(different ways of being the world) WORD THE WORLD BETTER narrative and storytelling from another prospective, sound (personal narrative, collective storytelling) (BOOKS: sonic agency,vibrant matter) MATTER MATTERS IN PROCESSES OF BECOMING\u2192 material storytelling denotes th central role of materiality SF\u2192 string figures, games with string figures giving and receving patterns (prototyping) choosing a figure \u00b6 (a figure that has a narrative with me but at the same time collects the others) The figure/not-figure that i choose is an animation that I\u2019ve modeled as a visual identity for an exhibition in a contemporary art gallery. According to me, this animation is my first trial as creating a visual identity for an art gallery that can resume the topics of the exhibition and at the same time attract people. The figure itself joins my inspirations -my design background- with my aspirations , as exploring and being part of the contemporary art world . Otherwise, it collects the others as a way of comunication and explanation of the exhibition; to create a bond between them in order to get closer the watcher with the artists projects. What now? II Intervention \u00b6 After the first intervention i\u2019ve questioned myself on what i can gain from the main topics that we touched with \u201cDown the Pipe\u201d. I found myself far removed from the concepts we explored in the first intervention, but at the same time satisfied that I learned new things. I felt closer to the \u2018device\u2019 we planned to monitor air pollution as a wearable device and how important the role of the body was. so my thinking went the other way: how can the body adapt to its surroundings, what is its feedback? what reaction does it provoke? The importance of data. 2.1 Process \u00b6 The main idea at the beginning was to use sensors that would produce a series of data sensed on contact with the body, or that would indicate the body\u2019s behaviour based on events happening around it. But then, influenced by Lucy McRae\u2019s projects and the cinematography related to dystopian futures where the body completely changed adaptation, many possibilities opened up as to where our project would go. We focused on a body that involves a forced adaptation of the body to a reality where it no longer recognises itself, and therefore requires \u2018evolution\u2019 in order to survive . 2.2 Ideation \u00b6 In order to make our idea concrete, we used a proximity sensor which, when connected to modelling software, such as Blender, is able to collect data, and use it to interact in real time with changes taking place within the software. We worked with different shapes: at first it was a matter of modifying the texture of some simple geometric entities, then we moved on to the 3D scanning of a body, and finally the modification of an agglomeration of metaballs, covered with a human texture. 2.3 Video \u00b6 Concept of hyperconnectivity : shifting the focus no more on a person-to-person relationship but passing trought the person-to-machine and ending in the irrepressible and irreversible relationship that eliminates pure personal physicality in the machine-to-machine relationship, which seems the only medium from here, to the near future. CYBER UNION :Sexual interactions in the future \u00b6 The concept of pleasure and physical enjoyment are no longer directed by the person-to-person connection but by the machine-to-machine interaction lead by two proximity sensors that create a fictitious connection between the two people, but, at the same time the deed is charged with intimacy and pleasure. The relationship results an interaction between two digital models that actually touch and interact as if it were a condition of sexual intimacy that brings pleasure.","title":"Design Studio 01"},{"location":"term1/03-Design%20Studio%2001/#design-studio-01","text":"03.10 During my past experience as a product designer I\u2019ve learnt that the action of prototyping an idea is the best way to spread it and make it one step closer to become real.

Using a computer-aided design (CAD) model as a blueprint, the printer adds material layer by layer, whether it\u2019s thermoplastic, resin, or metal, to form a solid object. Different printing technologies, such as Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Stereolithography (SLA), or Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), dictate the type of material and the layering process, resulting in a tangible product that mirrors the digital design. \u200d How does it work? The 3D printer works by interpreting a digital 3D model, slicing it into thin horizontal layers using specialized software, and then building the object layer by layer through additive manufacturing. Depending on the technology used, the printer deposits material, such as thermoplastic filament, liquid resin, or metal powder, layer by layer, with each layer fusing to the one below. The material is solidified using various methods like heating, UV curing, or laser sintering, resulting in a three-dimensional object that matches the digital design. \u200d How is it built? The 3D printer is constructed using a combination of mechanical, electronic, and software components. Mechanically, it features a frame that houses the moving parts, including the print head or extruder, and a build platform.

While the initial week was dedicated to disassembling and testing individual components, this week presented us with a unique challenge: to innovate and craft a new product using parts extracted from the printer. An intriguing twist to this assignment was the directive to design the machine to be as whimsical and non-functional as possible. This encouraged us to let our creativity run wild and embrace a playful approach. Even with a treasure trove of components at our disposal from the 3D printer\u2014including two motors, an extruder, and more\u2014we embraced an audacious and captivating concept: the LifeX, a so-called \u2018life expectancy predictor\u2019. \u200d At its core, LifeX uses the X-axis motor and belt system. With a simple push of a button, a pen draws a line on a paper below, supposedly predicting the age at which the user will pass away. It\u2019s a tongue-in-cheek nod to the dubious claims of some fortune tellers. In truth, an Arduino board is programmed to halt at a random number, influenced by the moment the user activates it. The motor maneuvers the pen across what we playfully dub your \u2018life bookmark\u2019, a creation thoughtfully crafted by one of our talented team members. This ticket, more than just a whimsical prediction, serves as a keepsake from this pseudo-paranormal encounter. Hold onto it and cherish the memory of this unique experience! We were privileged to be part of a diverse team, boasting a rich tapestry of skills from varied backgrounds. This multidisciplinary blend, from engineering acumen to artistic flair, was instrumental in propelling our project to completion. It was this collective genius that birthed such a unique and delightful machine. One of the most captivating stages of our journey was the decision-making process regarding which parts to repurpose from the printer and what additional elements we would introduce. We strategically utilized only essential components, complementing them with bespoke pieces crafted through 3D printing, CNC, and laser techniques\u2014thanks to the advanced digital fabrication facilities available at our school. ## Reflection Finally, I really enjoyed this seminar because it gave me the opportunity to actively participate in the process of assembling a functioning machine. It was a different experience for me because I had never experimented with this concept before. I also never fully understood the technical aspects ( more related to coding and programming) of a product or anything else. As a designer, I always saw that part as something that did not interfere with my work, mainly because it seemed too complex to comprehend. Well, it is indeed complex, but the reality is that working superficially to complete a task is no longer sufficient. It is essential to understand every aspect of our surroundings in our field. We worked excellently as a team! Each of us had our individual skills in specific areas, but we collaborated with one another on every task, learning from each other and also from failure: during the process we met a lot of obstacles, about the code, the 3d printed parts, the working mechanism... but i've really like that we work toghther for solving them ,or reshaping the project with some constraints that we met.","title":"The Machine Paradox"},{"location":"term1/04-The%20Machine%20Paradox/#the-machine-paradox","text":"17.10-27.10 3D MODEL","title":"THE MACHINE PARADOX"},{"location":"term1/04-The%20Machine%20Paradox/#forensic-report-fundaciocim-3d-printer","text":"Serial number: 01 150929 1189 Brand: FUNDACIOCIM Year: 2015 Model: BCN3D+ Weight: 11,6 kg Colour: BLACK/BLUE Made in: SPAIN","title":"Forensic Report: FundacioCIM 3D Printer"},{"location":"term1/04-The%20Machine%20Paradox/#forensic-questions","text":"What does it do? \u200d A 3D printer is a device that creates three-dimensional objects by layering material based on a digital design. Using a computer-aided design (CAD) model as a blueprint, the printer adds material layer by layer, whether it\u2019s thermoplastic, resin, or metal, to form a solid object. Different printing technologies, such as Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Stereolithography (SLA), or Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), dictate the type of material and the layering process, resulting in a tangible product that mirrors the digital design. \u200d How does it work? The 3D printer works by interpreting a digital 3D model, slicing it into thin horizontal layers using specialized software, and then building the object layer by layer through additive manufacturing. Depending on the technology used, the printer deposits material, such as thermoplastic filament, liquid resin, or metal powder, layer by layer, with each layer fusing to the one below. The material is solidified using various methods like heating, UV curing, or laser sintering, resulting in a three-dimensional object that matches the digital design. \u200d How is it built?

Breeding Grounds Breeding grounds are solid or liquid solutions containing nutrients on which eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells can grow. Bacterial media, those on which bacterial and other prokaryotic colonies can grow, are simpler than eukaryotic media. In groups, each one prepared a recipe for growing bacteria: with my group in order to cook Lactobacillus, we prepare this recipe with lemon, milk and agar agar. The process of making the recipe and thyen puring it into the petri dishes really intrigued me because it\u2019s really important about paying attemtion to mantain the environment sterilised. The next step was to \u201ccontaminate\u201d the petri dishes with everything that can start a bacteria culture, for example hairs, spit, but also swapping some objects inside. Unluckly, the most our our petri dishes didn\u2019t grow cultures during the night :( GMO PROPOSAL: a natural defense against pathogenic microorganisms in sludges \u00b6 My proposal for a genetic modified organism is strictly related at series of events that led to a tragedy in my region Emilia-Romagna (IT), in May 2023: 40,000 people had to evacuate their homes due to sudden flooding of canals that filled entire cities with water and mud, taking 16 victims with them. The flooding and geological occurrences were caused by continuous rainfall resulting from an occluded weather front that originated from the Atlantic. This weather front was fueled by a Mediterranean cyclone. These weather conditions led to extensive flooding, overflowing rivers, and landslides across the region from May 2 nd to May 17 th , 2023. Following the flood, numerous institutions stated that the event was accentuated by the inadequate management by the Emilia-Romagna Region of its territory, in particular its failure to intervene on the problems of hydrogeological instability and legislation on soil consumption. This type of calamity not only brings extreme discomfort due to the loss of property and the difficulty of telecommunications within a town, but also to human health. The water, in its path from the river or canal, carries with it a considerable amount of debris from the surrounding land or sewage from the probably clogged sewage system.These, fed by the flow of water, appear as piles of mud that stagnate even after the water has been removed. In the case of the floods in Emilia-Romagna, entire cities were covered in mud, which struggled to be cleared away, despite the large number of volunteers who rushed to the scene. In view of this, my GMO proposal aims to prevent the spread of bacteria within the water-borne mud during a flood.Certain fungi such as the mycelia of the Pleurotus and Phanerochaete are known for their ability to decompose polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other pollutants in the soil. They are already being used for bioremediation actions. Fungi such as Pleurotus ostreatus and Phanerochaete chrysosporium are known for their ability to degrade organic compounds, including hydrocarbons, through a process called biodegradation. These fungi produce extracellular enzymes that break down complex organic molecules, including hydrocarbons, into simpler compounds that can be absorbed and used as an energy source. The key enzymes involved in the breakdown of hydrocarbons are mainly oxidases, laccases, peroxidases and lignin peroxidases. These enzymes are responsible for breaking chemical bonds in hydrocarbons, making them more easily degradable and assimilable by fungi. I therefore identified certain types of plants that can be found near rivers and canals, and plants typical of green areas in cities, which, if strategically placed, could immediately absorb pathogenic microorganisms within the activated sludge and thus purify it. (as examples) - Phragmites australis - Juncus - maples The combination of the genes of these fungi, which are adept at decomposing hydrocarbons and purifying the soil, with some of these plants, could therefore be the beginning of a responsible use of the soil to stem certain misfortunes such as flooding, but at the same time be useful to everyday life by allowing cities to preserve, in green areas, usable soil for growing plants.

I\u2019ve really enjoyed all the week listening and learning about fields i\u2019ve never investigate so this stimulate me for a little reflection out of the academic context. It\u2019s very interesting getting more into biology related to design so using other organisms to \u201csolve actual problems\u201d, thinking about the benefits of spirulina, the usage of bacteria and viruses for vaccines,the practice of CRISP-Cas9, and so many other amazing things that really fascinate me but at the same time it seems quite selfish, using them for our own issues. The anthropocentric vision then has not shifted much? SECOND WEEK: Agri Zero \u00b6 Visiting Valldaura campus \u00b6 Testing and evaluating the soil \u00b6 Making essential oils \u00b6 we did one of two experiments using a traditional alambique to produce essential oil out of the laurel leafs some of our colleagues collected the day before at Valldaura. Reflection \u00b6 I\u2019ve really liked the approach of this week for all the activities we did, that were very pratical and side specific. In particular i\u2019ve enjoyed the trip to Valldaura Labs: to me it seemed like another type of lifestyle, far away of on what i\u2019m used to do in my everyday life but at the same time really intriguing. This, makes me realize that everyone in their life-path need a period completly immersed in nature and learning to live with it, but at the same time, i then realize that i don\u2019t know if i\u2019ll be able to manage it. I am too used to the comforts that a life in the city has given me since I was born: I would therefore like to take a step back, if only to understand what it is like. While the main subject of the seminar didn\u2019t align entirely with my primary interests it has been a very intense week full of new topics that perhaps if taken alone are not really in line with my interests, but if correlated and mixed with other suggestions, one could create truly stimulating insights or research, i\u2019m up for that!","title":"Bio & Agri Zero"},{"location":"term1/06-Bio%20%26%20Agri%20Zero/#bio-agri-zero","text":"07.11-17.11","title":"Bio &amp; Agri Zero"},{"location":"term1/06-Bio%20%26%20Agri%20Zero/#first-week-bio-zero","text":"","title":"FIRST WEEK: Bio Zero"},{"location":"term1/06-Bio%20%26%20Agri%20Zero/#growing-bacteria","text":"The second day we prepared some recipes for growing bacteria cultures.

Unluckly, the most our our petri dishes didn\u2019t grow cultures during the night :(","title":"Growing bacteria"},{"location":"term1/06-Bio%20%26%20Agri%20Zero/#gmo-proposal-a-natural-defense-against-pathogenic-microorganisms-in-sludges","text":"My proposal for a genetic modified organism is strictly related at series of events that led to a tragedy in my region Emilia-Romagna (IT), in May 2023: 40,000 people had to evacuate their homes due to sudden flooding of canals that filled entire cities with water and mud, taking 16 victims with them. The flooding and geological occurrences were caused by continuous rainfall resulting from an occluded weather front that originated from the Atlantic. This weather front was fueled by a Mediterranean cyclone. These weather conditions led to extensive flooding, overflowing rivers, and landslides across the region from May 2 nd to May 17 th , 2023. Following the flood, numerous institutions stated that the event was accentuated by the inadequate management by the Emilia-Romagna Region of its territory, in particular its failure to intervene on the problems of hydrogeological instability and legislation on soil consumption. This type of calamity not only brings extreme discomfort due to the loss of property and the difficulty of telecommunications within a town, but also to human health. The water, in its path from the river or canal, carries with it a considerable amount of debris from the surrounding land or sewage from the probably clogged sewage system.These, fed by the flow of water, appear as piles of mud that stagnate even after the water has been removed. In the case of the floods in Emilia-Romagna, entire cities were covered in mud, which struggled to be cleared away, despite the large number of volunteers who rushed to the scene. In view of this, my GMO proposal aims to prevent the spread of bacteria within the water-borne mud during a flood.Certain fungi such as the mycelia of the Pleurotus and Phanerochaete are known for their ability to decompose polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other pollutants in the soil. They are already being used for bioremediation actions. Fungi such as Pleurotus ostreatus and Phanerochaete chrysosporium are known for their ability to degrade organic compounds, including hydrocarbons, through a process called biodegradation. These fungi produce extracellular enzymes that break down complex organic molecules, including hydrocarbons, into simpler compounds that can be absorbed and used as an energy source. The key enzymes involved in the breakdown of hydrocarbons are mainly oxidases, laccases, peroxidases and lignin peroxidases. These enzymes are responsible for breaking chemical bonds in hydrocarbons, making them more easily degradable and assimilable by fungi. I therefore identified certain types of plants that can be found near rivers and canals, and plants typical of green areas in cities, which, if strategically placed, could immediately absorb pathogenic microorganisms within the activated sludge and thus purify it. (as examples) - Phragmites australis - Juncus - maples The combination of the genes of these fungi, which are adept at decomposing hydrocarbons and purifying the soil, with some of these plants, could therefore be the beginning of a responsible use of the soil to stem certain misfortunes such as flooding, but at the same time be useful to everyday life by allowing cities to preserve, in green areas, usable soil for growing plants.

Reflection \u00b6 The design with others seminar was a very interactive and a seminar that was very eyeopening. The first day of this module began with an informative session about soil and the interesting concepts that revolve around the community. Seeing communities through a different lens was taught me the importance of the needs and desires of communities in the rural parts of Barcelona. Discovering the community in the second half of first day allowed me to find out the artists community and the toy makers in the area. We (Me, Ana, Qian Yin and Manuja) had the opportunity to speak to an old artist and a toy maker called Juan. He shared with us his experience about being an old artist in the community that is slowly all becoming digital. We had the privilege to see his entire workspace and the tools he uses to create his masterpieces. This small interaction gave me the idea to work more in this field for the intervention through a creative way to depict art forms. The second day of the seminar was more about walking around the community and we had the opportunity to go see the Holon housing and see their sustainable way of living. I personally believe that was very important to see first hand and get a first person perspective on living so sustainably. Upon having the seminar on hollow housing, we divided ourselves into groups and worked on our intervention. Filling the different miro boards and going into the depth with the research of the community, was super helpful to narrow down the community area that we wanted to work within. As a group after having discussed the area that we wanted to focus on, we tried to come up with ideas to solve the issue. As a group we created a card game to bridge the gap between intergenerational artists and the different art forms and mediums. Creating this game was not only a fun activity but it also allowed me to learn a lot about how I can creatively solve a deep issue so lightly. Overall, the design with others seminar taught me tremendously in depth of the importance of keeping in mind of communities while designing.","title":"Design with Others"},{"location":"term1/07-Design%20with%20Others/#design-with-others","text":"WHAT\u2019S A COMMUNITY?

Here in Barcelona the feeling that i had was that the spaces, even IAAC, are so open to share their knowledge and i can also see the bound between each other. Another thing that I\u2019ve really enjoyed this week was that we did an activity together to my our class more \u201cour space\u201d, so we went to the laboratories and we immediatly start to build tables, useful during the labs seminars.

So I\u2019ve tried to take the speculative part of this intervention and reflect on what it means to violate the body. Healing The body, and more specifically the skin,has the incredible property of healing wounds and preserving itself from external agents that can injure it. I therefore began an experimental phase that put me to the test with the use of biomaterials and sensors to simulate wound healing and thus form another layer of skin, a human-derived one, that protects the body. Pain=Prompt I wondered how artificial intelligence could see terrible concepts such as violence and abuse, being based on datasets created in turn by human beings. I found it interesting to relate stories of fear and abuse to the generation of images and find, surprisingly, an extreme gap between what I imagined and what the AI generated. Feedback \u00b6 Summarily my research brought to the design dialogues brought positive feedback and stimulated interesting dialogues both with my colleagues and as outsiders; solprendently the focus was more on the design part of the images realised in AI, also because I had arranged the images interactively so that everyone could \u2018unveil\u2019 them by pretending a dark room with black ink. On the exhibition level, I realised that I want to stay with this type of arrangement. Moreover, the most relevant comments were on the one hand to investigate and research how to make a biomaterial, (or a tissue) as responsive as if it were a human tissue, also to introduce a still very controversial reflection: when two bodies interact, touch each other, where is the line that defines the behaviour as innocent to the point of violence? it is so thin\u2026 In addition, thoughts have arisen on the filters contained in AI from an ethical point of view, whether we need them, they protect us or are an obstacle that will increasingly limit us. Collocating my project \u00b6 I INTERVENTION: when u touch m \u00b6 1.1 process \u00b6 For my first intervention of the term, I decided to develop some of the thoughts I had gained during the Design Dialogues. I focused on the perception of our skin when we are touched: it is clear that to the detriment of the person and the context our reaction and the feedback the skin gives are different, but when we are in a context of abuse or violence the situation changes; it is all confused, mixed up, right but not right at the same time, \u201che didn\u2019t do it on purpose\u201d or \u201cmaybe it\u2019s my fault\u201d. And so you think back, you go back to analyse every part of what happened and you ask yourself, so how did it happen? I reflected on how fine the line really was between love and violence, from passionate touching to abuse. The love drive and the death drive were also defined by Freud as libido and destrudo , a concept I have always been fascinated by: if libido conceals sexual, almost animalistic instincts, destrudo is more incitement to self-destruction, but which, driven by other organs, Freud says, can be poured outwards towards others. Freud wrote this reasoning in response to a letter from Einstein who, with the Second World War still in progress, asked for a psychological explanation of the human being\u2019s tendency towards destruction and violence. Well, when does libido turn into destrudo? 1.2 ideation \u00b6 To further my research, I decided to continue experimenting with biomaterials. For the Digital Prototyping for Design seminar Flora and I had begun research into a wearable sensor that would release a pressure-modulated LED as feedback when touched. I therefore focused on two fundamental points: the search for a biomaterial that conducts electricity (see Digital Prototyping page) and what kind of feedback I wanted to obtain. In fact, I wanted to recreate an artefact that was more speculative than and therefore showed how touch pressure has a visual and audible repercussion, so I inserted two LED lights and a speacker that would dramatically highlight the moment when the DIY touch sensor recognised a more pronounced pressure. code #include \"pitches.h\"; #define touchPin T2 const int threshold = 50000 ; const int threshold2 = 80000 ; const int threshold3 = 100000 ; const int threshold4 = 120000 ; const int threshold5 = 140000 ; const int ledPin = 13 ; const int ledPin2 = 11 ; const int buzzer = 10 ; int touchValue ; int pitch = 0 ; void setup () { Serial . begin ( 115200 ); delay ( 10 ); // give me time to bring up serial monitor Serial . println ( \"ESP32 Touch Test\" ); pinMode ( ledPin , OUTPUT ); pinMode ( ledPin2 , OUTPUT ); pinMode ( buzzer , OUTPUT ); } void loop () { touchValue = touchRead ( touchPin ); Serial . println ( touchRead ( T2 )); // get value using T1 delay ( 10 ); if ( touchValue > threshold ) { // turn the LED on digitalWrite ( ledPin , HIGH ); } // if it 's lower than the threshold else { // turn the LED off digitalWrite ( ledPin , LOW ); } // if the value is greater than the threshold if ( touchValue > threshold5 ) { // turn the LED on digitalWrite ( ledPin2 , HIGH ); } // if it 's lower than the threshold else { // turn the LED off digitalWrite ( ledPin2 , LOW ); } if ( touchValue > threshold ) { pitch = NOTE_C2 ; } else if ( touchValue > threshold2 ) { pitch = NOTE_AS7 ; } else if ( touchValue > threshold3 ) { pitch = NOTE_A7 ; } else if ( touchValue > threshold4 ) { pitch = NOTE_GS7 ; } else if ( touchValue > threshold5 ) { pitch = NOTE_D8 ; } else { pitch = 0 ; } if ( pitch == 0 ) { noTone ( buzzer ); } else { tone ( buzzer , pitch ); } if ( pitch == 0 ) { noTone ( buzzer ); } else { tone ( buzzer , pitch ); } delay ( 10 ); } 1.3 Results \u00b6 References \u00b6 Arduino Capacitive Touch Sensing!

We took the opportunity to collaborate as we had some common themes but above all we both wanted to experiment with new software and approaches. Statement : Series of investigation on electronic wearables that detect the surroundings and the interations with them, and that translate it in a digital visualization Our first main idea was to create a outfit, composed by a belt and a skin wearable that allow to collect data while the person who is wearing them is constantly reacting with the surroundings, ad then, translating then in a digial identity made of the data. 2.2 Process \u00b6 Tools used \u00b6 Touch Sensor : Conducive Biomaterial: We started cooking the conductive biomaterial for creating a touch sensor that works even with pressure Recipe alginato de Sodio + CMC Celulosa Agua 200ml Alginato de sodio 8g CMC Celulosa 12,5g Glicerina 10g Harina 100 g Carbon Touch Sensor : Conductive textile We also tried to make a touch sensor with textiles and the velostat : Carbon impregnated black polyethylene film. - Conductivity is not affected by humidity or aging - Pressure and bend sensor - Resistance decreases across distance and changes under pressure. - <500 Ohms/cm - Carbon impregnated black polyethylene film. Conductivity is not affected by humidity or aging. For creating the touch sensor we use also the conductive tape, that we stick on the fabric of both sides, for indicating the positive and negative pole and then a layer of foam for isolating the two poles. TTGO Camera We use a TTGO Camera to detect, view, and analyze the things around us. We found it interesting to use as it provides us with a different perspective on ourselves that we cannot achieve from our first-person view. The original idea was to connect the camera to a 3D program in order to visualize and play. We wanted to connect the camera live to TouchDesigner. proximity sensor code int TRIG = 2 ; int ECHO = 4 ; int DURATION ; int DISTANCE ; void setup () { // ULTRASONIC SENSOR pinMode ( TRIG , OUTPUT ); pinMode ( ECHO , INPUT ); // SERIAL Serial . begin ( 9600 ); } void loop () { digitalWrite ( TRIG , HIGH ); delay ( 1 ); digitalWrite ( TRIG , LOW ); DURATION = pulseIn ( ECHO , HIGH ); DISTANCE = DURATION / 58.2 ; if ( DISTANCE > 0 && DISTANCE < 50 ){ Serial . println ( DISTANCE ); delay ( 100 ); } } touch sensor code #include \"pitches.h\"; #define touchPin T2 const int threshold = 80000 ; const int threshold2 = 80000 ; const int threshold3 = 100000 ; const int threshold4 = 120000 ; const int threshold5 = 140000 ; const int ledPin = 13 ; const int ledPin2 = 11 ; const int buzzer = 10 ; int touchValue ; int pitch = 0 ; void setup () { Serial . begin ( 115200 ); delay ( 10 ); // give me time to bring up serial monitor Serial . println ( \"ESP32 Touch Test\" ); pinMode ( ledPin , OUTPUT ); pinMode ( ledPin2 , OUTPUT ); pinMode ( buzzer , OUTPUT ); } void loop () { touchValue = touchRead ( touchPin ); Serial . println ( touchRead ( T2 )); // get value using T1 delay ( 10 ); if ( touchValue > threshold ) { // turn the LED on digitalWrite ( ledPin , HIGH ); } else { // turn the LED off digitalWrite ( ledPin , LOW ); } if ( touchValue > threshold5 ) { // turn the LED on digitalWrite ( ledPin2 , HIGH ); } else { // turn the LED off digitalWrite ( ledPin2 , LOW ); } if ( touchValue > threshold ) { pitch = NOTE_C2 ; } else if ( touchValue > threshold2 ) { pitch = NOTE_AS7 ; } else if ( touchValue > threshold3 ) { pitch = NOTE_A7 ; } else if ( touchValue > threshold4 ) { pitch = NOTE_GS7 ; } else if ( touchValue > threshold5 ) { pitch = NOTE_D8 ; } else { pitch = 0 ; } if ( pitch == 0 ) { noTone ( buzzer ); } else { tone ( buzzer , pitch ); } delay ( 10 ); } Proximity sensor We use the proximity sensor to detect the distance of objects and people. Concept of safety : the parameters we have researched and displayed are part of a data set that can detect the relationship a body has with its surroundings. We therefore decided to make wearable artefacts relative and subversive objects to the topic of security. We printed objects in resin and PLA that give the idea to those around them not to approach them because they are aggressive or that show privacy and intimacy. 2.3 Results \u00b6 Respectively, the two prints hypothesised as wearable on the shoulders and as a belt buckle.

So I\u2019ve tried to take the speculative part of this intervention and reflect on what it means to violate the body. Healing The body, and more specifically the skin,has the incredible property of healing wounds and preserving itself from external agents that can injure it. I therefore began an experimental phase that put me to the test with the use of biomaterials and sensors to simulate wound healing and thus form another layer of skin, a human-derived one, that protects the body. Pain=Prompt I wondered how artificial intelligence could see terrible concepts such as violence and abuse, being based on datasets created in turn by human beings.

For this to happen, it is important for each of us to understand where we stand in the world, whether we are privileged or not, what our backgrounds are in order to internalise the right approach. Summing up, we spent a week absorbing a lot of information on the main issues concerning the climate emergency and developed a reflection on them that led us to choose the focal points that intrigued us most to stimulate dialogue. climate emergency\u2192 the planet is too hot environment and animals are suffering Collapsing of human civilization OUT OF TIME Term Polycrisis \u00b6 The first presentation introduces the concept of Polycrisis and from there develops a series of considerations determined by its meaning: Polycrisis\u2192 (Adam Tooze) The word of the moment appears to be \u2018polycrisis\u2019, defined by Collins as the simultaneous occurrence of several catastrophic events.

This set the stage for a thought-provoking exploration that bridged the gap between diverse disciplines and perspectives. As the discussion unfolded, a substantial focus centered on the intricate concept of Time. This lecture really interested me because I have always been fascinated by the concept of time, its different conceptions and how it is explored in different areas: for example, the concept of relativity related to the passage of time, or the disruption of the flow of time in European literature at the beginning of the 20 th century, or even the cyclical conception of time from a more philosophical aspect. I often stop to think how the passing of minutes, hours days or years is a mere convention invented by man to quantify the passing of a life. We spend time scheduling events on a fictitious time organisation that is now lost with the solar day because we are used to living at night, we have artificial lights and entertainments that sometimes make us lose time. Yet time only flows in one direction, towards things we do not yet know, and it does not stop. Field Trip \u00b6 On the last day we made posters on some of the themes that had impressed us most during the week and, walking around Barceloneta My group and I focused on solar-centred design and the relationship humans have with the sun. We therefore made an interactive poster where there was a sun inside, and respectively each of its rays contained a sentence or a question on which we encouraged passers-by to reflect. We felt this was a more engaging way to get attention and talk about sensitive issues such as the climate emergency, as people tend to be intimidated by threatening phrases about the climate emergency and perhaps shy away from participating in a conversation. Reflection \u00b6 The seminar was very interesting and full of information, in fact I think I still need some time to process them again because given the environmental situation we are in, each one needs attention. I consider myself an average person who is concerned about climate issues but at the same time I don\u2019t consider myself to be an informed person in this regard, so this seminar was very useful for me to reflect on my surroundings and position myself in the world. It\u2019s not as obvious as it seems to be to find yourself and understand yourself, but above all to know where to go and thus to exchange your short-range vision. I think it is this kind of \u2018future-based\u2019 vision that is not only limited to a linear view but also a concentric and off-centre view that is the fundamental basis for a common consciousness and thus the real breakthrough for the climate emergency.","title":"Designing in a State of Climate Emergency"},{"location":"term2/02-Designing%20in%20a%20State%20of%20Climate%20Emergency/#term-polycrisis","text":"The first presentation introduces the concept of Polycrisis and from there develops a series of considerations determined by its meaning: Polycrisis\u2192 (Adam Tooze) The word of the moment appears to be \u2018polycrisis\u2019, defined by Collins as the simultaneous occurrence of several catastrophic events.

Yet time only flows in one direction, towards things we do not yet know, and it does not stop.","title":"Discussing our relationship with time and growth,"},{"location":"term2/02-Designing%20in%20a%20State%20of%20Climate%20Emergency/#field-trip","text":"On the last day we made posters on some of the themes that had impressed us most during the week and, walking around Barceloneta My group and I focused on solar-centred design and the relationship humans have with the sun. We therefore made an interactive poster where there was a sun inside, and respectively each of its rays contained a sentence or a question on which we encouraged passers-by to reflect. We felt this was a more engaging way to get attention and talk about sensitive issues such as the climate emergency, as people tend to be intimidated by threatening phrases about the climate emergency and perhaps shy away from participating in a conversation.","title":"Field Trip"},{"location":"term2/02-Designing%20in%20a%20State%20of%20Climate%20Emergency/#reflection","text":"The seminar was very interesting and full of information, in fact I think I still need some time to process them again because given the environmental situation we are in, each one needs attention.

It\u2019s not as obvious as it seems to be to find yourself and understand yourself, but above all to know where to go and thus to exchange your short-range vision. I think it is this kind of \u2018future-based\u2019 vision that is not only limited to a linear view but also a concentric and off-centre view that is the fundamental basis for a common consciousness and thus the real breakthrough for the climate emergency.","title":"Reflection"},{"location":"term2/03-Digital%20Prototyping%20For%20Design/","text":"TASK 1: \u00b6 Creating a project using bio materials and laser cutter Touch sensor \u00b6 For Design Dialogues I, I\u2019ve start my research related the connections of the body with its surroundings, and more specifically when acts of violence are inflicted by one body on another for sexual or passionate reasons (gender-based violence, feminicide). I presented a reflection on the concept of healing wounds and my desire to recreate a biomaterial that could simulate, in some way, human skin. firstly, I focused on the concept of healing, wondering if I could therefore make a biomaterial conductive. I performed a few tests, two of which proved positive. For the following exercise, Flora and I discussed these issues, converging my interests with hers related to the dynamics of contact between two bodies: we wanted to make visible a perception of being touched and at the same time investigate what the feedback of the skin in contact with a bio-material was. We therefore thought of making, starting from the experiments I had previously carried out, a touch sensor that would turn on a small LED as a feedback response to touch. I had already made a touch sensor using conductive tape and the biomaterial only as a coating. This time we wanted to test the sensor using conductive biomaterial instead of cables First step \u00b6 We began by defining two biomaterials that respectively occupy the roles of the sensor\u2019s coating, i.e. the visible outer part that will be laser-cut, and the conductive biomaterial that will be placed inside the sensor. Both of these two recipes are based on Agar Agar Agar recipe 300ml water 10 g agar agar 16g/32g glycerol (depends on the flexibility of the material we want to obtain) We decided to use salt in order to create a biomaterial that can conduct electricity, in fact: sodium chloride in the liquid state or in aqueous solution is a good conductor of electricity. This is because it dissociates into sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions when in this form. The charged ions allow electric current to flow through the solution. We did, however, face some difficulties as we were not aware of the amount of salt required to conduct electricity with a 3V battery (i.e. the smallest and therefore least bulky battery that we could fit in the sensor); furthermore, the drying time of a biomaterial (in this case agar) varies up to five days, if we do not create too thick a sample, so it extended the time for which we could test conductivity. In fact, we did several tests with different amounts of salt and came to the conclusion that if more than 20 g of salt are mixed, the conductivity with 6V is obtained. Researching the shape \u00b6 Our idea was to laser-cut the non-conductive agar material to a shape that would fit the body, like a prolugation of it; so we took two different paths: 1. design a shape that would remain in harmony with the body and be organic like a simulation of human skin 2. to design a shape that would detach itself from the body and refer to something technological like a wearable that was alien to the body, a bit cyberpunk Final considerations \u00b6 We both agreed that given the timeframe, it is not easy to build a small sensor that can work without cables, especially since we realised that material thicknesses and overall dimensions are critical to making a clean object. In addition, the arrangement of the objects inside is crucial to realise a functioning circuit, which, however, must be isolated from another material to allow the intermittent on/off function of the LED. We also made another mould of conductive material which we thought of engraving with laser cutting in order to be able to position the batteriers for not wasting volume, but we realised that in long contact with the material, they oxidise. Task 2 \u00b6 Creating an artifact by printing it using biomaterials with Marius Coaster from generative grasshopper file \u00b6 For this delivery Marius and I decided to make a biomaterial to print it, and we decided to use coffee to achieve a grainy texture.

If you think about it you feel violated, but nowadays we are used to sharing but are sentimentally attached to objects. So, the consideration of ourselves is less than the condration we have toward objects, where is the limit?we are used to sharing but are sentimentally attached to objects. So, the consideration of ourselves is less than the condration we have toward objects, where is the limit? The project was a very good example and test for me in collecting data in the most traditional way I know, because precisely the ways were already known it was interesting for me to be physically present and watch people\u2019s eyes change expression from one video to the next and try to associate with their face where they might have put the sticker on the billboard. Also, it is not easy to create a physical, unbiased intervention epr receive pure data: there are so many factors to take into consideration, chief among them is that the intervention is itself created by people for other people, which do not and never will have the impartiality and coldness of a machine. In fact, the results we got are influenced by really so many dimanics that are based not only on the survey but also on the dynamics created by the time of day when we submitted it to people, the place, the tone of voice \u2026 and so much more So, I would have liked to explore from a more technological point of view the collection of the dai perhaps using one of the other tools available, but at the same time it was interesting to try to see from another perspective a survey.","title":"Reflection"},{"location":"term2/07-Designing%20with%20Extended%20Intelligences/","text":"27.02-01.03 DOTTOD and Ai Modmatrix \u00b6 In this seminar we had the opportunity to play with some tools that Peter and Chris created as \u201cdottod\u201d i.e., a platform for generating images.

Research \u00b6 By intersecting our research, we found a common point in looking for wearables that collect data in certain social contexts, from events to everyday life, also related to the concept of protection. Certain types of sensors can detect changes in our surroundings that affect our bodies and our attitude under the circumstances. Statement: \u00b6 Series of investigation on electronic wearables that detect the surroundings and the interations with them, and that translate it in a digital visualization Artifact Description: \u00b6 Project planning \u00b6 Sketches \u00b6 Materials and technologies needed \u00b6 Touch Sensor: Conductive textile https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1v8qUhaarRCpX2TFIQKuj19j48BwxF2szUg2qXhQy8u8/edit#slide=id.g43aa799330_0_357 TTGO Camera https://www.tiktok.com/@espn/video/7153418979409874222?lang=es https://www.tiktok.com/@jordi.koalitic/video/7106530718012017926 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtBzbDm66wU&list=PLg4I7mDs8xeGnVRUS_2si_TmjoE82I342&index=44 Steps for use: Connect to the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi network. In the web browser, navigate to: 2.2.2.1 url of the stream: http://2.2.2.1:81/stream Touch Sensor: Conductive Biomaterial Proximity sensor In many of our projects, we have the need to sense our environment, to know if there is an obstacle in front and at what distance it is located. The HC-SR04 sensor allows us to do this. The HC-SR04 sensor is a distance sensor that uses ultrasonic transducers to detect objects. Its operation consists of emitting an ultrasonic sound through one of its transducers, and waiting for the sound to bounce off any present object; the echo is captured by the second transducer. The distance is proportional to the time it takes for the echo to arrive. - Resin Printing - Pla Printing Fabrication process \u00b6 Our first main idea was to create a outfit, composed by a belt and a skin wearable that allow to collect data while the person who is wearing them is constantly reacting with the surroundings, ad then, translating then in a digial identity made of the data. Touch Sensor: Conducive Biomaterial: \u00b6 We started cooking the conductive biomaterial for creating a touch sensor that works even with pressure Recipe: alginato de Sodio + CMC Celulosa Agua 200ml Alginato de sodio 8g CMC Celulosa 12,5g Glicerina 10g Harina 100 g Carbon After discussing together we realize that for the time we had and the tests we supposed to do with the biomaterial, we decided to dedicate ourselfs to the sensors, as the proximity. During the first review the professors suggested us to use cameras for recordigns video of the surroundings and have a sort of 360 view (as the cars have in their assets) related also to the topic of safety and protection we want to address; so, we start investigating with the TTPO cameras. https://github.com/annafedele/microchallenge/assets/143884501/2e62ab73-343f-420e-96c8-4eee715032ec Touch Sensor: Conductive Textile: \u00b6 We also tried to make a touch sensor with textiles and the velostat : Carbon impregnated black polyethylene film. Conductivity is not affected by humidity or aging -Pressure and bend sensor -Resistance decreases across distance and changes under pressure. -<500 Ohms/cm v -Carbon impregnated black polyethylene film. Conductivity is not affected by humidity or aging. For creating the touch sensor we use also the conductive tape, that we stick on the fabric of both sides, for indicating the positive and negative pole and then a layer of foam for isolating the two poles. We applied a hole in the foam for creating the \u201cbutton\u201d and the layer of velostat, so we the button is pressed the ciurcut can run releasing data. TTGO Camera: \u00b6 We use a TTGO Camera to detect, view, and analyze the things around us. We found it interesting to use as it provides us with a different perspective on ourselves that we cannot achieve from our first-person view. The original idea was to connect the camera to a 3D program in order to visualize and play. We wanted to connect the camera live to TouchDesigner. We encountered many issues with just visualizing the camera in its original program. We used the URL ( http://2.2.2.1:81/stream ) to connect the IP to TouchDesigner, To obtain that link: press Control + Shift + I, select the camera, and it will provide you with the URL link. using the Video Stream in TOP in Touch Designer. https://derivative.ca/UserGuide/Video_Stream_In_TOP Video Stream In Top Node Documentation. However, even after many attempts, we were unable to find a solution. Proximity Sensor: \u00b6 We use the proximity sensor to detect the distance of objects and people. We manage to connect the data that the sensor give in the serial monotior of arduino with touch designer: at first we imported the data and then we transformed in values. With touchdesigner it is possible to apply the variation of values to some features of the geometry you model so at the beginning we apply the modification to the geometry and the to the texture. Resin Printing: \u00b6 PLA Printing: \u00b6 Fabrication files \u00b6 code that we used for proximity sensor \u00b6 ```proximity sensor int TRIG = 2; int ECHO = 4; int DURATION; int DISTANCE; void setup() { // Sensore ad ultrasuoni pinMode(TRIG, OUTPUT); pinMode(ECHO, INPUT); // Seriale Serial.begin(9600); } void loop() { digitalWrite(TRIG, HIGH); delay(1); digitalWrite(TRIG, LOW); DURATION = pulseIn(ECHO, HIGH); DISTANCE = DURATION / 58.2; if (DISTANCE > 0 && DISTANCE < 50) { Serial.println(DISTANCE); delay(100); } } ### *code that we used for touch sensor:* ```touch sensor #include \"pitches.h\"; #define touchPin T2 const int threshold = 80000; const int threshold2 = 80000; const int threshold3 = 100000; const int threshold4 = 120000; const int threshold5 = 140000; const int ledPin = 13; const int ledPin2= 11; const int buzzer = 10; int touchValue; int pitch = 0; void setup() { Serial.begin(115200); delay(10); // give me time to bring up serial monitor Serial.println(\"ESP32 Touch Test\"); pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT); pinMode(ledPin2, OUTPUT); pinMode(buzzer, OUTPUT); } void loop() { touchValue = touchRead (touchPin); Serial.println(touchRead(T2)); // get value using T1 delay(10); if (touchValue > threshold) { // turn the LED on digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); } // if it's lower than the threshold else { // turn the LED off digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW); } // if the value is greater than the threshold if (touchValue > threshold5) { // turn the LED on digitalWrite(ledPin2, HIGH); } // if it's lower than the threshold else { // turn the LED off digitalWrite(ledPin2, LOW); } if (touchValue > threshold) { pitch = NOTE_C2; } else if (touchValue > threshold2) { pitch = NOTE_AS7; } else if (touchValue > threshold3) { pitch = NOTE_A7; } else if (touchValue > threshold4) { pitch = NOTE_GS7; } else if (touchValue > threshold5) { pitch = NOTE_D8; } else { pitch = 0; } if(pitch == 0) { noTone(buzzer); } else { tone(buzzer, pitch); } if (pitch == 0) { noTone(buzzer); } else { tone(buzzer, pitch); } delay(10); } Learning outcomes \u00b6 Results \u00b6 At the end of the challenge, the difficulties we encountered were not few, because when it comes to investigating and improvising with technology, a lot of testing is required, and especially when you are a novice, it is complicated to make things work in a reasonable time. The results we achieved are very good in terms of investigation and discovery of new software for us: we achieved results by connecting the respective sensors to touch trainers to create the visuals we wanted, but we did not achieve the goal of creating an outfit because we spent a lot of time and energy trying to make the technological parts of our project work, which corresponded to at least 80% of the parts. Reflection \u00b6 The challenge for us was to investigate and make many attempts to achieve the result we had envisaged from the beginning. It was incredibly useful and satisfying to try some of the practices that we had not experimented with so thoroughly, to understand them and then solve the mistakes, and it led to a growth in our skills but also in our awareness of what can and cannot be done within the given timeframe. Future outcomes \u00b6 In the future, we would like to continue working on creating a complete outfit that can visualise data in real time and use it in certain social situations to understand how the visualisation of the data transforms and deforms the visuals we create, but also in terms of safety and it is interesting to understand how the surroundings relate to the person (and thus the body) and whether situations of violence or abuse can occur. What we could improve \u00b6 Having only a few days to realise a project combining the interests of two people, we were constantly trying to find a compromise, but at the same time we lost the project flow a little because as we continued with the experiments we modified the idea according to our results. In addition, the technological factor of understanding and interacting with sensors and programmes slowed down our design process and was binding on the fate of the project, in fact we did not achieve the goal of creating a single device but a series of explorations with different devices.

With touchdesigner it is possible to apply the variation of values to some features of the geometry you model so at the beginning we apply the modification to the geometry and the to the texture.","title":"Proximity Sensor:"},{"location":"term2/Micro%20Challenges/#resin-printing","text":"","title":"Resin Printing:"},{"location":"term2/Micro%20Challenges/#pla-printing","text":"","title":"PLA Printing:"},{"location":"term2/Micro%20Challenges/#fabrication-files","text":"","title":"Fabrication files"},{"location":"term2/Micro%20Challenges/#code-that-we-used-for-proximity-sensor","text":"```proximity sensor int TRIG = 2; int ECHO = 4; int DURATION; int DISTANCE; void setup() { // Sensore ad ultrasuoni pinMode(TRIG, OUTPUT); pinMode(ECHO, INPUT); // Seriale Serial.begin(9600); } void loop() { digitalWrite(TRIG, HIGH); delay(1); digitalWrite(TRIG, LOW); DURATION = pulseIn(ECHO, HIGH); DISTANCE = DURATION / 58.2; if (DISTANCE > 0 && DISTANCE < 50) { Serial.println(DISTANCE); delay(100); } } ### *code that we used for touch sensor:* ```touch sensor #include \"pitches.h\"; #define touchPin T2 const int threshold = 80000; const int threshold2 = 80000; const int threshold3 = 100000; const int threshold4 = 120000; const int threshold5 = 140000; const int ledPin = 13; const int ledPin2= 11; const int buzzer = 10; int touchValue; int pitch = 0; void setup() { Serial.begin(115200); delay(10); // give me time to bring up serial monitor Serial.println(\"ESP32 Touch Test\"); pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT); pinMode(ledPin2, OUTPUT); pinMode(buzzer, OUTPUT); } void loop() { touchValue = touchRead (touchPin); Serial.println(touchRead(T2)); // get value using T1 delay(10); if (touchValue > threshold) { // turn the LED on digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); } // if it's lower than the threshold else { // turn the LED off digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW); } // if the value is greater than the threshold if (touchValue > threshold5) { // turn the LED on digitalWrite(ledPin2, HIGH); } // if it's lower than the threshold else { // turn the LED off digitalWrite(ledPin2, LOW); } if (touchValue > threshold) { pitch = NOTE_C2; } else if (touchValue > threshold2) { pitch = NOTE_AS7; } else if (touchValue > threshold3) { pitch = NOTE_A7; } else if (touchValue > threshold4) { pitch = NOTE_GS7; } else if (touchValue > threshold5) { pitch = NOTE_D8; } else { pitch = 0; } if(pitch == 0) { noTone(buzzer); } else { tone(buzzer, pitch); } if (pitch == 0) { noTone(buzzer); } else { tone(buzzer, pitch); } delay(10); }","title":"code that we used for proximity sensor"},{"location":"term2/Micro%20Challenges/#learning-outcomes","text":"","title":"Learning outcomes"},{"location":"term2/Micro%20Challenges/#results","text":"At the end of the challenge, the difficulties we encountered were not few, because when it comes to investigating and improvising with technology, a lot of testing is required, and especially when you are a novice, it is complicated to make things work in a reasonable time. The results we achieved are very good in terms of investigation and discovery of new software for us: we achieved results by connecting the respective sensors to touch trainers to create the visuals we wanted, but we did not achieve the goal of creating an outfit because we spent a lot of time and energy trying to make the technological parts of our project work, which corresponded to at least 80% of the parts.","title":"Results"},{"location":"term2/Micro%20Challenges/#reflection","text":"The challenge for us was to investigate and make many attempts to achieve the result we had envisaged from the beginning.

In addition, the technological factor of understanding and interacting with sensors and programmes slowed down our design process and was binding on the fate of the project, in fact we did not achieve the goal of creating a single device but a series of explorations with different devices.","title":"What we could improve"},{"location":"term2/Micro%20Challenges/#references-resources","text":"https://youtube.com/watch?v=xesuhh_ZPpY&list=PLg4I7mDs8xeGnVRUS_2si_TmjoE82I342&index=21&t=539s detection the surrounding https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnrWjQ_zO-s&t=1178smorphing the surrounding https://github.com/LilyGO/ESP32-Camera https://youtu.be/-ldPPhnGDVE https://www.does-work.com/projects/mira-does-unnoticed-identities Does Work Studio- Unnotices Identities Project. https://naylampmechatronics.com/blog/10_tutorial-de-arduino-y-sensor-ultrasonico-hc-sr04.html ultrasonic sensor arduino documentation https://youtube.com/watch?v=xesuhh_ZPpY&list=PLg4I7mDs8xeGnVRUS_2si_TmjoE82I342&index=21&t=539s touch designer tutorial: detecting the surrounding https://frontiernerds.com/brain-hack project https://projecthub.arduino.cc/adithyalokesh17/lets-make-arduino-sing-with-a-buzzer-26d11b let\u2019s make arduino sing tutorial. https://snapdrop.net/ https://github.com/LilyGO/esp32-camera-bme280 TTGO Camera Documentation. https://cults3d.com/es/modelo-3d/variado/agisis-ultimate-alien-face-hugger-detailed resin model https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtBzbDm66wU&list=PLg4I7mDs8xeGnVRUS_2si_TmjoE82I342&index=44 Video Example of Camera RT with Touch Designer. https://class.textile-academy.org/2024/julija-karas/assignments/week05/","title":"References + Resources:"}]}
