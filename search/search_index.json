The act of documenting- so writing down our ideas, reflection or show images or video- is useful to spread our thoughts to other people and to preserve the mental processes that we do for an activity. It\u2019s also a way to organize all the chaos that i have in my mind and let it be understandable to myself In addiction, it\u2019s important to add a proper narrative to the elements of documentation, NARRATIVE Characters Context Plot Conflict Resolution Emotion Visuals Reflection Narrative Flow for this reason each of us in the class have to create and update a personal website with all the contents and reflections about the journey here at IAAC. So, two things that I\u2019ve never use so to do will be part of my everyday life: coding and documenting. If i have to be honest, i\u2019m not so good on keep things updated in one singular space, because i tend to create or use many spaces to annotate things, but i have to admit that this way is not really useful and it doesn\u2019t help my mind to remember all the concepts; in addiction i always change my mind about the structure on how i want to keep my notes, mostly because I let myself be influenced by other\u2019s ideas, which in part is helpful, but on the other hand makes me lose my own creativity;this is the reason why i want to keep my template similar to the default one, in order to costumize it only with my small editigs, and when i\u2019ll be ready, i\u2019ll chose my own structure and interface. At present, I\u2019m giving my best effort to both documenting and coding. \ud83d\ude0a","title":"Documenting Design"},{"location":"term1/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/","text":"Atlas of Weak Signals \u00b6 In the seminar \u201cAtlas of weak signals\u201d, they explained us how to build our Design Space, as a space of interests we\u2019d like to investigate in many field related to an emergent future situation.

Prototype makes you realize things that in your mind have a theoretically a direction and a sense, but sometimes they take another way when you try to basically make them; and i\u2019m not talking only about the physical part of a product like dimensions and materials, but also concepts and ideas: i think that prototyping can let you understand even how your idea is communicated, or which status is it. In my opinion, it\u2019s really interesting how prototyping could involve people, binding them to each other ideas in order to participate to an effective design intervention: prototyping is the medium of an intervention, a tangible way of sharing ideas. During the lecture, we spoke about 4 types of prototyping: Roles of Prototyping PP as experimental component , (most common) testing specifing hyopthesis PP as a meas of inquiry , that gives you something back (collect, record and measure) PP as a research archetype , physical embodiments of concepts (exeplary and illustrative) PP as a vehicle of inquiry , focus on process of making (answer qestion by making) Reflecting on these four types of prototyping related to design interventions, i think that I\u2019ve use many times the first type, in an academic way, but it\u2019s the third type that interested me the most: I\u2019ve had the chance to see and learn about many \u201cresearch archetype prototypes\u201d, as I\u2019ve work in a contemporary art gallery. There, we host not only artworks, but entire e complete projects with an specific aim, so i had experienced the design intervention in both ways: as a spectator, but also as a part of the making process because i was the medium inside the gallery to comunicate people the projects. Group exercise \u00b6 We also did an activity related into changing roles of PP of our classmates old projects. I choose Jorge\u2019s project that was about designing a lint roller. We collocated his project in the PP\u2019s role 1, as the prototype was made to experiment a specific idea. I thought that it could be interesting move the emphasis of the project not on the object itself, but on the materials and the process what this object could be make. So I\u2019ve designed a toolkit where the part of the lint roller are modular and in different materials, focusing on the PP\u2019s role 4. DESIGN INTERVENTION \u00b6 31.01-5.11 Unfourtunatly i wasn\u2019t able to participate to the exercise about the collective design workspace with the whole class, but i found out that there were other people that were missing on monday, so we created a group composed by Nicol\u00f2, Anthuanet, Sophie, Marius and I We initiated our journey during this initial Design Intervention by exchanging our personal Design Spaces. Despite our diverse backgrounds and varying aspirations, we unearthed a shared set of common values. Process \u00b6 So, we collocated the place of our intrvention in metro stations: People from diverse backgrounds utilize public transportation, placing them in direct contact with the myriad conditions and experiences it entails. The underground environment is intriguing not only in terms of shared space among individuals but also in its interaction with bacteria, noise, stress, recreation, education, and more. Our goal is to raise awareness about the air quality conditions in public transportation, with a specific emphasis on Barcelona\u2019s Metro System. As governments and citizens increasingly call for expanded public transit networks, it becomes essential to assess and unveil the environmental consequences of these systems Ideation and prototyping \u00b6 To address this challenge, we\u2019ve armed ourselves with a PM2.5 sensor. Evaluating PM2.5 levels is critical for assessing air quality because these particles serve as vital indicators of health risks stemming from air pollution. PM2.5 refers to particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller. These minuscule particles are capable of penetrating deep into the lungs and can even enter the bloodstream, leading to significant health issues. We\u2019ve connected this sensor to a speaker that provides real-time feedback on air quality at various stations within Barcelona\u2019s Metro. During a typical commute from La Pau Station to Bogatell on the L4 Metro, (that\u2019s my journey to reach IAAC) we used the sensor\u2019s readings to audibly illustrate the invisible airborne threats we unknowingly inhale. After the intervention we discovered that, in average the values of PM2.5 were lower in 6 stations, but raise in Besos and Bogatell, due to the scarse air ventilation in the metro station or the affluence of people According to me, the most interesting thing about this intervention ,a part from the enviromental sensing, was the fact that we were able to create a little project with a specific purpose, related also to sensors, in a few time. it will be interesting to develop the intervention adding some other values to evaluate or to costumize the box that we use for the sensing: changing the materials, the shape and the composition of the electronic parts inside.

Using a computer-aided design (CAD) model as a blueprint, the printer adds material layer by layer, whether it\u2019s thermoplastic, resin, or metal, to form a solid object. Different printing technologies, such as Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Stereolithography (SLA), or Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), dictate the type of material and the layering process, resulting in a tangible product that mirrors the digital design. \u200d How does it work? The 3D printer works by interpreting a digital 3D model, slicing it into thin horizontal layers using specialized software, and then building the object layer by layer through additive manufacturing. Depending on the technology used, the printer deposits material, such as thermoplastic filament, liquid resin, or metal powder, layer by layer, with each layer fusing to the one below. The material is solidified using various methods like heating, UV curing, or laser sintering, resulting in a three-dimensional object that matches the digital design. \u200d How is it built? The 3D printer is constructed using a combination of mechanical, electronic, and software components. Mechanically, it features a frame that houses the moving parts, including the print head or extruder, and a build platform. These components are driven by motors, guided by linear rails or rods, ensuring precise movements on the X, Y, and Z axes. Electronically, a main control board processes digital instructions from the slicing software, directing the motors and regulating the temperature of the print head or curing source. Additionally, various sensors monitor conditions like temperature and filament presence, while the software interface allows users to configure settings, load models, and initiate the printing process. \u200d Why it failed, or it wasn\u2019t used anymore? The 3D printer still functions, but it\u2019s an older, unstable model with low accuracy and print quality. Powering things up \u00b6 \u200d After the disassembly process, we meticulously examined each individual component. Utilizing a precision lab power supply and a high-resolution multimeter, we conducted comprehensive tests to determine the optimal voltage required for each component\u2019s functionality. \u200d ??? WHAT WE POWER UP DC Lab Power Supply - How we brought individual 3D Printer components back to life We monitored the temperature of the hot plate while gradually increasing the voltage We check the temperature sensor looking at the values We dissasemble the part of the extruder Results \u00b6 How many motors did we find inside? Five motors - they are used to move the extruder in the three axis to permit drawing in 3D space. \u200d Does it contain a computer or microcontroller? Yes, an Arduino board and a RAMPS. Did you found any sensors? Yes, temperature sensors. Conclusions \u00b6 What did you learn? How a 3D printer is assembled How a 3D printer works How to power up each component individually Fundamental electronics How a step motor works \u200d What surprised you? The number of components, screws and pieces the printer had The fact that we can make the extruder work with just 3 components How easy and repareable it is How much the 3D technology has improved since 2015 (Almost Useful) Machines - LifeX \u00b6 In Week 2 of the \u2018Machine Paradox\u2019 phase, we took our achievements from Week 1 to the next level. While the initial week was dedicated to disassembling and testing individual components, this week presented us with a unique challenge: to innovate and craft a new product using parts extracted from the printer. An intriguing twist to this assignment was the directive to design the machine to be as whimsical and non-functional as possible. This encouraged us to let our creativity run wild and embrace a playful approach. Even with a treasure trove of components at our disposal from the 3D printer\u2014including two motors, an extruder, and more\u2014we embraced an audacious and captivating concept: the LifeX, a so-called \u2018life expectancy predictor\u2019. \u200d At its core, LifeX uses the X-axis motor and belt system. With a simple push of a button, a pen draws a line on a paper below, supposedly predicting the age at which the user will pass away. It\u2019s a tongue-in-cheek nod to the dubious claims of some fortune tellers. In truth, an Arduino board is programmed to halt at a random number, influenced by the moment the user activates it. The motor maneuvers the pen across what we playfully dub your \u2018life bookmark\u2019, a creation thoughtfully crafted by one of our talented team members. This ticket, more than just a whimsical prediction, serves as a keepsake from this pseudo-paranormal encounter. Hold onto it and cherish the memory of this unique experience! We were privileged to be part of a diverse team, boasting a rich tapestry of skills from varied backgrounds. This multidisciplinary blend, from engineering acumen to artistic flair, was instrumental in propelling our project to completion. It was this collective genius that birthed such a unique and delightful machine. One of the most captivating stages of our journey was the decision-making process regarding which parts to repurpose from the printer and what additional elements we would introduce. We strategically utilized only essential components, complementing them with bespoke pieces crafted through 3D printing, CNC, and laser techniques\u2014thanks to the advanced digital fabrication facilities available at our school. ## Reflection Finally, I really enjoyed this seminar because it gave me the opportunity to actively participate in the process of assembling a functioning machine. It was a different experience for me because I had never experimented with this concept before. I also never fully understood the technical aspects ( more related to coding and programming) of a product or anything else. As a designer, I always saw that part as something that did not interfere with my work, mainly because it seemed too complex to comprehend. Well, it is indeed complex, but the reality is that working superficially to complete a task is no longer sufficient. It is essential to understand every aspect of our surroundings in our field. We worked excellently as a team! Each of us had our individual skills in specific areas, but we collaborated with one another on every task, learning from each other and also from failure: during the process we met a lot of obstacles, about the code, the 3d printed parts, the working mechanism... but i've really like that we work toghther for solving them ,or reshaping the project with some constraints that we met.","title":"The Machine Paradox"},{"location":"term1/04-The%20Machine%20Paradox/#the-machine-paradox","text":"17.10-27.10 3D MODEL","title":"THE MACHINE PARADOX"},{"location":"term1/04-The%20Machine%20Paradox/#forensic-report-fundaciocim-3d-printer","text":"Serial number: 01 150929 1189 Brand: FUNDACIOCIM Year: 2015 Model: BCN3D+ Weight: 11,6 kg Colour: BLACK/BLUE Made in: SPAIN","title":"Forensic Report: FundacioCIM 3D Printer"},{"location":"term1/04-The%20Machine%20Paradox/#forensic-questions","text":"What does it do? \u200d A 3D printer is a device that creates three-dimensional objects by layering material based on a digital design.

While the initial week was dedicated to disassembling and testing individual components, this week presented us with a unique challenge: to innovate and craft a new product using parts extracted from the printer. An intriguing twist to this assignment was the directive to design the machine to be as whimsical and non-functional as possible. This encouraged us to let our creativity run wild and embrace a playful approach. Even with a treasure trove of components at our disposal from the 3D printer\u2014including two motors, an extruder, and more\u2014we embraced an audacious and captivating concept: the LifeX, a so-called \u2018life expectancy predictor\u2019. \u200d At its core, LifeX uses the X-axis motor and belt system. With a simple push of a button, a pen draws a line on a paper below, supposedly predicting the age at which the user will pass away. It\u2019s a tongue-in-cheek nod to the dubious claims of some fortune tellers. In truth, an Arduino board is programmed to halt at a random number, influenced by the moment the user activates it. The motor maneuvers the pen across what we playfully dub your \u2018life bookmark\u2019, a creation thoughtfully crafted by one of our talented team members. This ticket, more than just a whimsical prediction, serves as a keepsake from this pseudo-paranormal encounter. Hold onto it and cherish the memory of this unique experience! We were privileged to be part of a diverse team, boasting a rich tapestry of skills from varied backgrounds. This multidisciplinary blend, from engineering acumen to artistic flair, was instrumental in propelling our project to completion. It was this collective genius that birthed such a unique and delightful machine. One of the most captivating stages of our journey was the decision-making process regarding which parts to repurpose from the printer and what additional elements we would introduce. We strategically utilized only essential components, complementing them with bespoke pieces crafted through 3D printing, CNC, and laser techniques\u2014thanks to the advanced digital fabrication facilities available at our school. ## Reflection Finally, I really enjoyed this seminar because it gave me the opportunity to actively participate in the process of assembling a functioning machine. It was a different experience for me because I had never experimented with this concept before. I also never fully understood the technical aspects ( more related to coding and programming) of a product or anything else. As a designer, I always saw that part as something that did not interfere with my work, mainly because it seemed too complex to comprehend. Well, it is indeed complex, but the reality is that working superficially to complete a task is no longer sufficient. It is essential to understand every aspect of our surroundings in our field. We worked excellently as a team! Each of us had our individual skills in specific areas, but we collaborated with one another on every task, learning from each other and also from failure: during the process we met a lot of obstacles, about the code, the 3d printed parts, the working mechanism... but i've really like that we work toghther for solving them ,or reshaping the project with some constraints that we met.","title":"(Almost Useful) Machines - LifeX"},{"location":"term1/05-Living%20with%20your%20own%20ideas/","text":"Living with your own ideas \u00b6 31.10-03.11 During this seminar we focus on the concept of fist person perspective 1 st Person Research\u2192 to be situated as actors in environment and generate change taking your own culture in a specific project (involving yourself as a political act) interventions deals with different temporalities involve ourself to understand the interaction around us (relational and expansive) look at things, being involve decentering humans by displacing power relations (making yourself vulnerable) After talking about 1pp we start with prototyping a companion WHY, A COUPLE OF REASONS FOR\u2026 \u00b6 COMPANION, INDIPENDECE THE NEED TO BE SELF-RELIANT how will you live together? \u00b6 it should be on my desk, or hang somewhere in my room ,or in a place where i usually work. what does it notice? \u00b6 it notices in me self-confidence in my potentialities. it basically gives \u201creason\u201d under shape of little post-it (gives by pressing buttons).

Bacterial media, those on which bacterial and other prokaryotic colonies can grow, are simpler than eukaryotic media. In groups, each one prepared a recipe for growing bacteria: with my group in order to cook Lactobacillus, we prepare this recipe with lemon, milk and agar agar.

Unluckly, the most our our petri dishes didn\u2019t grow cultures during the night :( GMO PROPOSAL: a natural defense against pathogenic microorganisms in sludges \u00b6 My proposal for a genetic modified organism is strictly related at series of events that led to a tragedy in my region Emilia-Romagna (IT), in May 2023: 40,000 people had to evacuate their homes due to sudden flooding of canals that filled entire cities with water and mud, taking 16 victims with them. The flooding and geological occurrences were caused by continuous rainfall resulting from an occluded weather front that originated from the Atlantic. This weather front was fueled by a Mediterranean cyclone. These weather conditions led to extensive flooding, overflowing rivers, and landslides across the region from May 2 nd to May 17 th , 2023. Following the flood, numerous institutions stated that the event was accentuated by the inadequate management by the Emilia-Romagna Region of its territory, in particular its failure to intervene on the problems of hydrogeological instability and legislation on soil consumption. This type of calamity not only brings extreme discomfort due to the loss of property and the difficulty of telecommunications within a town, but also to human health. The water, in its path from the river or canal, carries with it a considerable amount of debris from the surrounding land or sewage from the probably clogged sewage system.These, fed by the flow of water, appear as piles of mud that stagnate even after the water has been removed. In the case of the floods in Emilia-Romagna, entire cities were covered in mud, which struggled to be cleared away, despite the large number of volunteers who rushed to the scene. In view of this, my GMO proposal aims to prevent the spread of bacteria within the water-borne mud during a flood.Certain fungi such as the mycelia of the Pleurotus and Phanerochaete are known for their ability to decompose polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other pollutants in the soil. They are already being used for bioremediation actions. Fungi such as Pleurotus ostreatus and Phanerochaete chrysosporium are known for their ability to degrade organic compounds, including hydrocarbons, through a process called biodegradation. These fungi produce extracellular enzymes that break down complex organic molecules, including hydrocarbons, into simpler compounds that can be absorbed and used as an energy source. The key enzymes involved in the breakdown of hydrocarbons are mainly oxidases, laccases, peroxidases and lignin peroxidases. These enzymes are responsible for breaking chemical bonds in hydrocarbons, making them more easily degradable and assimilable by fungi. I therefore identified certain types of plants that can be found near rivers and canals, and plants typical of green areas in cities, which, if strategically placed, could immediately absorb pathogenic microorganisms within the activated sludge and thus purify it. (as examples) - Phragmites australis - Juncus - maples The combination of the genes of these fungi, which are adept at decomposing hydrocarbons and purifying the soil, with some of these plants, could therefore be the beginning of a responsible use of the soil to stem certain misfortunes such as flooding, but at the same time be useful to everyday life by allowing cities to preserve, in green areas, usable soil for growing plants.

Here in Barcelona the feeling that i had was that the spaces, even IAAC, are so open to share their knowledge and i can also see the bound between each other. Another thing that I\u2019ve really enjoyed this week was that we did an activity together to my our class more \u201cour space\u201d, so we went to the laboratories and we immediatly start to build tables, useful during the labs seminars. I really love the approach of doing and making because i was used to think a lot before starting doing something and most of times it stayed theoretical. We had also a great teamwork! Finally on friday we visited the ELISAVA school where some experts explain us about the lab that they have, (btw they\u2019re a lot). ELISAVA is also another reality different from IAAC maybe with an a scholastic approch, but the labs are really amazing, letting us the possibility to develop project in many different ways and with many different medium.","title":"Landing"}]}
