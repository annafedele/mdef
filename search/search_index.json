They give us many ways of defining a design space, but the one that I\u2019ve preferred, it\u2019s the design space as a mirror : I can clearly see it as a reflection of my inner person, as a professional and non figure.

In order to build our space, we\u2019ve firstly played this sort of card game: it contains cards for weak signals, areas of opportunity and random triggers , in order to stimulate dialogues between each other and develop a an idea-project for an specific emergent future field. I find this exercise interesting and stimulating in thinking by steps: the game starts first with weak signals, areas of opportunity and random trigger, giving us the possibility to create links between the cards step by step, developing a layered mental process. We did an example in class: My own AOWS \u00b6 Looking at all the cards in the deck,i decided not to follow a precise methodology, instead I\u2019ve preferred to let me guide on what weak signals interest me the most. I was intrigued in \u201cReconfigure your body\u201d and \u201cDismantling filter bubbles\u201d because i feel them close to my personal experience and I\u2019ve related them to a state of versatility of the body that it has always to change in order to sustain our fast lifestyle and erase the isolation created by algorithm (filter bubbles) that they convey our everyday life online and also how this could de in an close future. New cards for the deck \u00b6 I\u2019ve also thought of a new weak signal to add to the deck, and I\u2019ve named it \u201c New political arrangement \u201d: according to me, society will develop in the future - in a negative or positive way- with its own facets and declinatios that, for me, are constantly evolving. For this reason, also politics and political parties, establish to collect society\u2019s ideas and willingness, will constantly change their arrangements, so it should be take in consideration as a weak signal. My own space is also non-defined as a establish way, it expands its meaning concentrically, like the water in a lake when you drop a stone in it. The key word for my space is empathy : being able to feel other person feeling to such an extent that those feeling become yours. The space is about re-establishing balances between the triads human-technology-space because now is an never ending battle for taking over the other two, and maybe it\u2019s necessary to look back to understand how to manage the future. Another important topic that really intrigued me is the regenerative design, in this case, as something that can solve its own errors, rebirth every time.","title":"AoWS"},{"location":"term1/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#atlas-of-weak-signals","text":"In the seminar \u201cAtlas of weak signals\u201d, they explained us how to build our Design Space, as a space of interests we\u2019d like to investigate in many field related to an emergent future situation.

Prototype makes you realize things that in your mind have a theoretically a direction and a sense, but sometimes they take another way when you try to basically make them; and i\u2019m not talking only about the physical part of a product like dimensions and materials, but also concepts and ideas: i think that prototyping can let you understand even how your idea is communicated, or which status is it. In my opinion, it\u2019s really interesting how prototyping could involve people, binding them to each other ideas in order to participate to an effective design intervention: prototyping is the medium of an intervention, a tangible way of sharing ideas. During the lecture, we spoke about 4 types of prototyping: Roles of Prototyping PP as experimental component , (most common) testing specifing hyopthesis PP as a meas of inquiry , that gives you something back (collect, record and measure) PP as a research archetype , physical embodiments of concepts (exeplary and illustrative) PP as a vehicle of inquiry , focus on process of making (answer qestion by making) Reflecting on these four types of prototyping related to design interventions, i think that I\u2019ve use many times the first type, in an academic way, but it\u2019s the third type that interested me the most: I\u2019ve had the chance to see and learn about many \u201cresearch archetype prototypes\u201d, as I\u2019ve work in a contemporary art gallery. There, we host not only artworks, but entire e complete projects with an specific aim, so i had experienced the design intervention in both ways: as a spectator, but also as a part of the making process because i was the medium inside the gallery to comunicate people the projects. GROUP EXERCISE \u00b6 We also did an activity related into changing roles of PP of our classmates old projects. I choose Jorge\u2019s project that was about designing a lint roller. We collocated his project in the PP\u2019s role 1, as the prototype was made to experiment a specific idea. I thought that it could be interesting move the emphasis of the project not on the object itself, but on the materials and the process what this object could be make. So I\u2019ve designed a toolkit where the part of the lint roller are modular and in different materials, focusing on the PP\u2019s role 4.","title":"Design Studio 01"},{"location":"term1/03-Design%20Studio%2001/#design-studio-01","text":"","title":"Design Studio 01"},{"location":"term1/03-Design%20Studio%2001/#0310","text":"During my past experience as a product designer I\u2019ve learnt that the action of prototyping an idea is the best way to spread it and make it one step closer to become real.

Using a computer-aided design (CAD) model as a blueprint, the printer adds material layer by layer, whether it\u2019s thermoplastic, resin, or metal, to form a solid object. Different printing technologies, such as Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Stereolithography (SLA), or Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), dictate the type of material and the layering process, resulting in a tangible product that mirrors the digital design. \u200d How does it work? The 3D printer works by interpreting a digital 3D model, slicing it into thin horizontal layers using specialized software, and then building the object layer by layer through additive manufacturing. Depending on the technology used, the printer deposits material, such as thermoplastic filament, liquid resin, or metal powder, layer by layer, with each layer fusing to the one below. The material is solidified using various methods like heating, UV curing, or laser sintering, resulting in a three-dimensional object that matches the digital design. \u200d How is it built? The 3D printer is constructed using a combination of mechanical, electronic, and software components. Mechanically, it features a frame that houses the moving parts, including the print head or extruder, and a build platform. These components are driven by motors, guided by linear rails or rods, ensuring precise movements on the X, Y, and Z axes. Electronically, a main control board processes digital instructions from the slicing software, directing the motors and regulating the temperature of the print head or curing source. Additionally, various sensors monitor conditions like temperature and filament presence, while the software interface allows users to configure settings, load models, and initiate the printing process. \u200d Why it failed, or it wasn\u2019t used anymore? The 3D printer still functions, but it\u2019s an older, unstable model with low accuracy and print quality. Powering things up \u00b6 \u200d After the disassembly process, we meticulously examined each individual component. Utilizing a precision lab power supply and a high-resolution multimeter, we conducted comprehensive tests to determine the optimal voltage required for each component\u2019s functionality. \u200d DC Lab Power Supply - How we brought individual 3D Printer components back to life The supply powering the printer hot plate We monitored the temperature of the hot plate while gradually increasing the voltage \u200d Connecting the power-supply to the extruder The printer monitor displaying again after a very long rest Powering the printer nozzle Extruder melting filament Results \u00b6 How many motors did we find inside? Five motors - they are used to move the extruder in the three axis to permit drawing in 3D space. \u200d Does it contain a computer or microcontroller? Yes, an Arduino board and a RAMPS. \u200d Did you found any sensors? Yes, temperature sensors. Conclusions \u00b6 What did you learn? How a 3D printer is assembled How a 3D printer works How to power up each component individually Fundamental electronics How a step motor works \u200d What surprised you?
